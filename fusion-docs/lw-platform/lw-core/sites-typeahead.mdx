Typeahead in Core Settings, also known as autocomplete or autosuggest, is a feature that provides real-time query and phrase suggestions as a user types into a search bar.
It helps users find relevant results faster by predicting what they are trying to search.

As the user enters text into the search box, the system predicts possible queries and displays instant suggestions in a dropdown menu.
As the user types more characters, the suggestions refine dynamically.
For an ecommerce website, product suggestions are shown.
For an enterprise company search, it helps the user find documents and data easier and faster.
The user can click on a suggestion to select it and complete the query.

Typeahead benefits include increased speed at getting users to results and improved accuracy that helps prevent and correct spelling mistakes.

## Core Settings Typeahead configuration

Typeahead in Core Settings includes a management screen, where you can review and revise the typeahead configuration.
It includes tabs for Suggested Typeahead, Custom Typeahead, and Excluded Typeahead.
Within each tab, there is a button to create a new entry and a trashcan icon for each row to delete an existing entry.
For finding a specific typeahead term, you can use the search bar to quickly locate it.
After making changes, you can choose to discard the changes or publish them by clicking on the respective button at the bottom of the screen.

### Suggested Typeahead

Suggested Typeahead is generated hourly from the top 1,000 search terms captured by the [signals beacon](/lw-platform/analytics/k649vy/signals-beacon) or the [Signals API](/lw-platform/analytics/uist05/signals-api).
If there are any suggestions that are not wanted or needed, you can remove them.
When you remove a typeahead suggestion, itâ€™s added to the Excluded Typeahead list.

### Custom Typeahead

Custom Typeahead is a way to add search suggestions that help guide users toward important content.
You can suggest important terms that may not be generated automatically from the top 1000 search terms.
For example, an ecommerce company running a sales event might use custom suggestions to highlight terms like "spring deals" or "clearance."
A company hosting an event could suggest searches related to key pages like the event schedule or speaker bios.

You might want to exclude certain keywords from typeahead for several reasons:

* Frequently searched terms, such as "sale," might dominate typeahead if not excluded, reducing variety in suggestions.
* Filter out generic terms such as "info" or "product" that provide little user intent and might not help guide the user to meaningful content.
* Exclude typeahead suggestions that do not support business goals, such as low-value queries or terms that distract from high-intent, conversion-focused results.

Lucidworks AI custom embedding model training lets you train and deploy custom models using the [Custom model training user interface](/lw-platform/ai/6bb9s5/lw-ai-custom-embedding-model-training-user-interface/index) or the [Lucidworks AI Models API](/lw-platform/ai/e63rmi/models-api).

## Training data

Custom embedding model training uses the following types of data:

* Signals acquired from user interactions on your website
* Customer questions and answers your organization collects from logs and forums your organization collects
* Information from documents obtained from queries on your website
* Datasets and other information labeled on your website

For more detailed information, see [use case training data](/lw-platform/ai/g0ji3z/custom-embedding-model-training-data).

## RNN models

Lucidworks AI supports the following types of recurrent neural network (RNN) models:

* **General.** The general RNN model is typically used by knowledge management sites that contain information, such as news or documentation
* **ecommerce.** An ecommerce RNN model is typically used by sites that provide products for purchase

For more detailed information, see [RNN models](/lw-platform/ai/b18rw1/custom-embedding-rnn-models).

## Transformer RNN models

Lucidworks AI supports the transformer with the general RNN head model, which is typically used by knowledge management sites that contain information, such as news or documentation.

For more detailed information, see [Transformer RNN models](/lw-platform/ai/gmhy47/custom-embedding-transformer-rnn-models).

## Custom configuration

Custom configuration parameters can be used to train a custom model using either the [Custom model training user interface](/lw-platform/ai/6bb9s5/lw-ai-custom-embedding-model-training-user-interface/index) or the [Lucidworks AI Models API](/lw-platform/ai/e63rmi/models-api).

For more detailed information, see [Custom configuraton](/lw-platform/ai/tnwswb/custom-configuration).

Lucidworks AI provides certain pre-trained embedding models.
These models are also publicly available and most of the model names have not been changed, so they can be searched under the model name at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).

To generate a list of models for your organization, see the [Lucidworks AI Use Case API](/lw-platform/ai/0stpyb/use-case-api).

To run requests for individual use cases, see [LWAI Prediction API](/lw-platform/ai/8bx4m9/predict-api).

## Model families

The pre-trained models provided are in the E5, GTE, BGE, and ARCTIC families. Each model is different, and you may need to index using several different models to determine what is most effective for your dataset and domain.

### E5

Models in the E5 family are state-of-the-art text encoders that are satisfactory for a wide range of tasks. For details about the training of E5 models, see [e5-base-v2](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-base-v2).

#### E5 Multilingual

The E5 models family shows very strong quality on our multilingual benchmark. Each document or query in a batch can be in a different language, and different languages can exist within each document or query.

### GTE

The GTE models are a very strong family of models that surpass the E5 family on public benchmarks. In our benchmarks, it shows comparable quality with the E5 family, depending on the particular data and domain.

### BGE

The BGE model family shows the best quality among open source models on public benchmarks. In our benchmarks, it shows comparable quality with the E5 and GTE families, which again depends on the particular dataset. For more information about the training of BGE models see the [pre-train repository](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding/blob/master/examples/pretrain/README.md) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).

### ARCTIC

The Snowflake Arctic text embedding models suite focuses on creating high-quality retrieval models, which are highly competitive on public benchmarks. For more information you can visit Hugging Face or their [Snowflake Lab arctic embed git repository](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/arctic-embed).

## Model size guide

This chart is designed to help determine the best model size for each model family. Factors to consider regarding model size include:

* Smaller vector sizes use less space in collections than larger vector sizes.
* Smaller models are easier to scale and have quicker responses, but quality may be less than the base and large models.

| Model size | Vector size | Quality | Performance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Extra Small | 384 | Medium | Fast+ |
| Small | 384 | Medium | Fast |
| Base | 768 | High | Medium |
| Large | 1024 | Very High | Slow |

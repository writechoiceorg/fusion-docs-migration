## Prerequisites

* Fusion 5.9.5 or later
* Lucidworks Platform license
* Before you can use Lucidworks AI, you must set up the [Lucidworks AI Gateway](/lw-platform/ai/41gdb7/lucidworks-ai-gateway).

## Pre-trained embedding models

Lucidworks provides state-of-the-art [pre-trained embedding models](/lw-platform/ai/3vqfxe/pre-trained-embedding-models) to support semantic vector search (SVS).

You can use Lucidworks AI to choose the models that best suit your organizational needs. Lucidworks consistently evaluates and tests new models and enhancements to existing models. When an enhancement or a new model is verified to be effective on the platform, it is released.

## Custom embedding model training

Lucidworks provides a [Custom model training user interface](/lw-platform/ai/6bb9s5/lw-ai-custom-embedding-model-training-user-interface/index) that lets you quickly train, deploy, and manage custom models.

You can also use the [Lucidworks AI Models API](/lw-platform/ai/e63rmi/models-api) to perform those tasks.

Custom trained models are essential for ecommerce and other use cases with a domain-specific language. Custom model training uses:

* Signals data that enables optimization for particular business use cases and metrics.
* Graphics processing units (GPUs) for optimal performance.

The Lucidworks AI model training user interface provides evaluation metrics to easily compare trained models. Lucidworks provides small and efficient custom models that scale to thousands of queries per second (QPS) without decreasing the quality of embeddings.

## GenAI with open and closed source models

Lucidworks provides [GenAI use cases](/lw-platform/ai/r7ai90/generative-ai) such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG), summarization, and keyword extraction. New use cases are added on a regular basis, and are accessible immediately through the Fusion stages integration with Lucidworks AI.

## Seamless integration with Fusion

To utilize models within a Fusion pipeline, Lucidworks provides [query and indexing pipeline stages](/lw-platform/ai/b5uv9z/fusion-stages) that integrate with Lucidworks AI.

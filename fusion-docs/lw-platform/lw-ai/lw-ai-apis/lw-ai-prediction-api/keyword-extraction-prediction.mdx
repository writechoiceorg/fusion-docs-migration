View API specification

In the Keyword extraction use case of the [LWAI Prediction API](/lw-platform/ai/8bx4m9/prediction-api), the LLM ingests text and returns a JSON response that contains a list of keywords extracted from the text. No options can be configured.

This use case can be used:

* To extract keywords to create new facets
* To extract keywords from each document:

  + To write the keyword into a new field that subsequently searches large content documents more efficiently
  + To boost specific keyword content
  + For document clustering

## Prerequisites

To use this API, you need:

* The unique `APPLICATION_ID` for your Lucidworks AI application. For more information, see [credentials to use APIs](/lw-platform/platform/oqzogo/index#credentials).
* A bearer token generated with a scope value of `machinelearning.predict`. For more information, see [Authentication API](/lw-platform/ai/oa96k5/authentication-api).
* The `USE_CASE` and `MODEL_ID` fields for the use case request. The path is: `/ai/prediction/USE_CASE/MODEL_ID`. A list of supported models is returned in the [Lucidworks AI Use Case API](/lw-platform/ai/0stpyb/use-case-api). For more information about supported models, see [Generative AI models](/lw-platform/ai/r7ai90/generative-ai#generative-ai-models).

## Common parameters and fields

Some parameters in the `/ai/async-prediction/USE_CASE/MODEL_ID` request are common to all of the generative AI (GenAI) use cases, such as the `modelConfig` parameter.
Also referred to as hyperparameters, these fields set certain controls on the response.
Refer to the [API spec](?open-api=true) for more information.

## Unique values for the keyword extraction use case

Some parameter values in the `keyword extraction` use case are unique and may not be available in other use cases, including values for the `useCaseConfig` parameter.
Refer to the [API spec](?open-api=true) for more information.

## Example request

This example does not include `modelConfig` parameters, but you can submit requests that include parameters described in [Common parameters and fields](#common-parameters-and-fields).

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://APPLICATION_ID.applications.lucidworks.com/ai/prediction/keyword-extraction/MODEL_ID \

      "text": "Joseph Robinette Biden Jr.is an American politician who is the 46th and current president of the United States. Ideologically a moderate member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 under President Barack Obama and represented Delaware in the United States Senate from 1973 to 2009.Born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden moved with his family to Delaware in 1953. He studied at the University of Delaware before earning his law degree from Syracuse University. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and to the U.S. Senate in 1972. As a senator, Biden drafted and led the effort to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act. He also oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. Biden ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008. In 2008, Obama chose Biden as his running mate, and Biden was a close counselor to Obama during his two terms as vice president. In the 2020 presidential election, Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, defeated incumbents Donald Trump and Mike Pence. Biden is the second Catholic president in U.S. history (after John F. Kennedy), and his politics have been widely described as profoundly influenced by Catholic social teaching."

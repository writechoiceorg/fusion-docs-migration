View API specification

In the Summarization use case of the [LWAI Prediction API](/lw-platform/ai/8bx4m9/prediction-api), the LLM ingests text and returns a summary of the text as a response.

The context length is 2048 tokens. No options can be configured.

This use case can be used to condense the text of a large document into a summarized response.

## Prerequisites

To use this API, you need:

* The unique `APPLICATION_ID` for your Lucidworks AI application. For more information, see [credentials to use APIs](/lw-platform/platform/oqzogo/index#credentials).
* A bearer token generated with a scope value of `machinelearning.predict`. For more information, see [Authentication API](/lw-platform/ai/oa96k5/authentication-api).
* The `USE_CASE` and `MODEL_ID` fields for the use case request. The path is: `/ai/prediction/USE_CASE/MODEL_ID`. A list of supported models is returned in the [Lucidworks AI Use Case API](/lw-platform/ai/0stpyb/use-case-api). For more information about supported models, see [Generative AI models](/lw-platform/ai/r7ai90/generative-ai#generative-ai-models).

## Common parameters and fields

Some parameters in the `/ai/async-prediction/USE_CASE/MODEL_ID` request are common to all of the generative AI (GenAI) use cases, such as the `modelConfig` parameter.
Also referred to as hyperparameters, these fields set certain controls on the response.
Refer to the [API spec](?open-api=true) for more information.

## Unique values for the summarization use case

Some parameter values available in the `summarization` use case are unique to this use case, including values for the `useCaseConfig` parameter.
Refer to the [API spec](?open-api=true) for more information.

## Example request

This example does not include `modelConfig` parameters, but you can submit requests that include parameters described in [Common parameters and fields](#common-parameters-and-fields).

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://APPLICATION_ID.applications.lucidworks.com/ai/prediction/summarization/MODEL_ID \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "batch": [
    {
      "text": "Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys'\'' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets - but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too."
      },

      "maxWords": 100

The following is an example response:

```json
{
  "predictions": [
    {
      "tokensUsed": {
       "promptTokens": 248,
       "completionTokens": 65,
       "totalTokens": 313
       },
      "response": "A decade after the Dursleys found their nephew on their doorstep, Privet Drive remains largely unchanged. The only noticeable difference is in the family photographs, which now depict Dudley Dursley as a large blond boy engaged in various activities, replacing his baby pictures. There is no indication of another boy living in the house."
      }
    ]

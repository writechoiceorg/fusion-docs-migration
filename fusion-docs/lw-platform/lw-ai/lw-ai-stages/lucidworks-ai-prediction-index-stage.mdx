The LWAI Prediction index stage is an integration between Fusion and Lucidworks AI to enrich your index with [Generative AI](/lw-platform/ai/r7ai90/generative-ai) predictions.
More detailed information to configure this stage is in [Configure the LWAI Prediction index stage](/how-to/ua7khh/configure-fusion-lwai-prediction-index-stage).

By default, the Fusion `Call Asynchronously?` field is selected, which specifies this stage uses the [Lucidworks AI Async Prediction API](/lw-platform/ai/55ug0f/async-prediction-api) endpoints.

If the Fusion `Call Asynchronously?` field is *not* selected, this stage uses the [LWAI Prediction API](/lw-platform/ai/8bx4m9/prediction-api) endpoints.

To use this stage, non-admin Fusion users must be granted the `PUT,POST,GET:/LWAI-ACCOUNT-NAME/**` permission in Fusion, which is the Lucidworks AI API Account Name defined in [Lucidworks AI Gateway](/lw-platform/ai/41gdb7/lucidworks-ai-gateway) when this stage is configured.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

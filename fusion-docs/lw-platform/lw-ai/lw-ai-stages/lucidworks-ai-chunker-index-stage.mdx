The LWAI Chunker Index Stage asynchronously breaks down large text documents into smaller, semantically meaningful chunks, vectorizes those chunks for [Neural Hybrid Search](/fusion/5.9/u1gxz0/chunking#chunking-in-neural-hybrid-search), and stores those vectors in Solr. For more information, see the [Lucidworks AI Async Chunking API](/lw-platform/ai/fpqd94/async-chunking-api).

To use this stage, non-admin Fusion users must be granted the `PUT,POST,GET:/LWAI-ACCOUNT-NAME/**` permission in Fusion, which is the Lucidworks AI API Account Name defined in [Lucidworks AI Gateway](/lw-platform/ai/41gdb7/lucidworks-ai-gateway) when this stage is configured.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

Lucidworks AI Gateway is a specialized service that enables secure and authenticated access to Lucidworks AI, allowing Fusion to seamlessly integrate with both pre- and custom-trained AI models hosted on Lucidworks AI.

<Note>
This feature is only available for Fusion 5.9.5 and up.
</Note>



Before you can use Lucidworks AI with self-hosted Fusion, you must configure Lucidworks AI Gateway.
See [Configure A Lucidworks AI Gateway Integration](/how-to/y6euxl/configure-a-lucidworks-ai-gateway-integration) for instructions.
Managed Fusion clients can work with their Client Success/Technical Account Manager (CSTAM) team for a Lucidworks AI Gateway integration.

## How Lucidworks AI Gateway works

Lucidworks AI Gateway acts as a bridge between Fusion and Lucidworks AI, handling the complexities of authentication and communication.
By managing credentials and other sensitive information behind the scenes, it ensures that Fusion can interact with Lucidworks AI without exposing the details of the underlying accounts or requiring manual authentication.

In Lucidworks AI, you have one or more integrations that each represent a set of credentials and a security scope.
When you add an integration to Lucidworks AI Gateway, it allows Fusion to seamlessly connect to Lucidworks AI at any time without additional authentication.

## Key features of Lucidworks AI Gateway

* **Credential Management:**
  The gateway securely manages credentials through Fusionâ€™s secret management system.
  It ensures that only the necessary account name is exposed, keeping other sensitive details private.
* **Seamless Model Integration:**
  Fusion services can use the Lucidworks AI Gateway to access both pre-trained and custom-trained AI models, enabling a wide range of AI-driven functionalities within Fusion.
* **Flexible Configuration:**
  The gateway allows for multiple integrations to be configured.
  Each account can have its own set of credentials and associated scopes, which define the operations it can perform.
  If certain configuration properties are not provided at the account level, default settings can be used instead.

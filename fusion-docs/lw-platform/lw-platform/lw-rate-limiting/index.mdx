Rate limiting is used to help control network traffic and performance based on configuration of the timing and repetition of requests allowed on the network.

Lucidworks Platform employs rate limiting to:

* Provide a reliable service and optimal network performance for client organizations.
* Protect clients from exceeding contracted consumption quotas which could result in overage charges.

Each of the Lucidworks Platform APIs uses a similar approach:

* Rate limitations are specified in the Lucidworks contract for your organization. Typically, most of the simple operations that do not impact query time are set to a lower rate limit. APIs considered to be in the critical path for query performance use a separate, higher rate limit.
* If the request rate to a particular API exceeds the relevant limit, the system generates the [HTTP 429 Too Many Requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) error. To resolve the issue, Lucidworks recommends you retry the request by implementing an [exponential backoff pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff).

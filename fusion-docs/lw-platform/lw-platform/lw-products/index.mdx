The Products screen of Lucidworks Platform displays Lucidworks AI applications for your site.

For an application to function correctly, other integration tasks are completed by Lucidworks. Contact your Lucidworks representative for assistance.

## Add an application

1. Sign in to [Lucidworks Platform](https://platform.lucidworks.com).
2. On the Lucidworks Platform welcome screen, click **+ New**.
3. On the Create an application screen, click **Lucidworks AI** and enter the following information:

   * Enter a unique name in the Application name field. Required fields display with an asterisk (*).
   * In the Description field, enter a short description of the application.
   * In the Region field, select the region where you want to store application data, and where queries will access the data.

     <Warning>
     **Caution**
     
     Region selection is permanent.
     </Warning>


4. Click **Create**. To exit without creating the application, click **Exit**.

<Note>
The Application name and Description fields cannot be edited after the application is created. You would need to delete the application and create it with the new information. To delete an application, point to three dots next to the application you want to delete and click **Delete App**. On the confirmation screen, click **Delete**. To exit without deleting the application, click **Cancel**.
</Note>



### Add user permissions

When the app is created, the Add user permissions screen displays.

You can assign application permissions to existing Lucidworks Platform user accounts. Users are added using the [invite users](/lw-platform/platform/00j8nx/users-and-provisioning#invite-users) procedure.

1. To grant permission to perform particular application functions for an existing user, click **+Add User**.

2. Enter the Lucidworks user name. If the Lucidworks user account is not valid, you cannot add the user and permissions to the app. If the user is valid, you can select the permission role for the application.

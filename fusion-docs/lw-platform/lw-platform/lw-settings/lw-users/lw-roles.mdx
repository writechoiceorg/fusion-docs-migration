To perform actions in Lucidworks Platform, you must be granted access and rights controlled by setting entitlements, permissions, and roles.

Certain settings are configured by your Technical Account Manager, such as entitlements that grant access and privileges in a specified workspace. Contact your Lucidworks representative for more information.

## Permissions

A permission defines the specific actions a user or system can perform, often tied to a resource, such as accessing a data source, modifying a configuration, or running an application process.

## Workspace roles

A workspace role grants a set of permissions on a scope, which is based on your customer ID or a specific application. Roles give varying rights to perform configuration or application actions. A user can have different roles from application to application but can only be assigned one workspace role.

### Workspace owners

A workspace owner can create, manage, and delete all applications and users for the specified workspace.

Only workspace owners can perform the following tasks:

* Create and delete an application
* Invite and remove users from an application
* Add and remove roles from any user

### Workspace members

Based on rights granted, a workspace member can view or manage the specified application. By default, workspace members have no access to any applications.

The application roles are as follows:

* An **App admin** can perform the following tasks in an application:

  + Edit all parts of that application
  + Add, edit, and delete data sources
  + Edit the settings, including the values embeds and signals
* An **App viewer** can view the specified application, associated data sources, and its usage dashboard. They cannot edit the application in any way, such as adding data sources or users to the application.
* An **Analytics viewer** can view analytics information and the signals beacon configuration on the Integrations Embeds screen.
* **API credentials access** can view general information about Lucidworks AI APIs and client credentials for their organization.
* If the role is set to **No Access**, the user cannot view or edit the application.

### Model trainers

A model trainer can perform the following tasks in an application:

* Train custom embedding models
* Deploy custom embedding models
* View the specified application, associated data sources, and its usage dashboard. They cannot edit the application in any way, such as adding data sources or users to the application.

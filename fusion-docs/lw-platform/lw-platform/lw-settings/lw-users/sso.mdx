</Tip>



Lucidworks Platform supports single sign-on (SSO), which restricts user logins to specified email domains and uses your organization’s identity provider authentication method instead of Lucidworks' built-in authentication.
Workspace owners can configure SSO via [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](#oidc-authentication) or [Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)](#saml-authentication).

# OIDC Authentication

[OIDC](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) is an authentication protocol based on the OAuth 2.0 framework, which uses HTTPS endpoints to retrieve user data. It uses JSON web tokens (JWT) to authenticate user identity data (also known as claims).
Tokens are digitially signed and can also be encrypted.

Complete all of the following procedures to configure OIDC authentication.

## 1. Create users in Lucidworks Platform

<Tip>
**Important**


Prerequisites

1. Users must be added to the Lucidworks Platform.
2. Users must exist in your OKTA instance, and be enabled for the OKTA application you are using to connect with Lucidworks Platform.
3. The user’s email address in OKTA and Lucidworks Platform must match.

</Tip>



1. Sign in to [Lucidworks Platform](https://platform.lucidworks.com) and click **Settings > Users & Provisioning > Users**.
2. Verify all necessary users are listed, active, and their emails match their Okta user counterparts.
3. If any users are missing, add the appropriate users by completing the steps in [invite users](/lw-platform/platform/00j8nx/users-and-provisioning#invite-users).

## 2. Create a new application in Okta

1. Set up a [new application in Okta](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/apps/apps_app_integration_wizard_oidc.htm). The following fields are specific to setting up an integration with Lucidworks:

   * **Sign-in method**: Select **OIDC**.
   * **Application type**: Select **Web Application**.
   * **Sign-in redirect URIs**: Leave this blank for now. You’ll configure it in a later step.
   * **Logout redirect URIs**: Remove all URIs.
   * **Controlled access**: Choose **Allow everyone in your organization to access**.
   * **Enable immediate access**: Uncheck **Enable immediate access with Federation Broker Mode**.
2. After creating the OIDC app, copy the **Client ID** and the **Client Secret**, and save them in a secure location.

   <Tip>
   **Important**
   The **Client ID** and the **Client Secret** credentials are critical for OIDC communication and must be kept secure.
   </Tip>


3. Assign at least one user and one admin to the application. These users must already exist in Lucidworks Platform. You must assign yourself as one of the users to be able to complete the authentiation configuration.

## 3. Create the Identity Provider in Lucidworks Platform

1. Sign in to [Lucidworks Platform](https://platform.lucidworks.com) and click **Settings > Users & Provisioning > Authentication > OIDC**.
2. Enter values in the required fields:

   * **Email Domains**: Enter the list of domains you want to use as filter options, for example, `\lucidworks.com`.

     <Warning>
     Be careful not to lock yourself out at this step in the process. If you list a domain that you already use to log into Lucidworks Platform, and you don’t complete the rest of the steps listed here, then you will be prompted to log in via SSO the next time you log out, which won’t work. If you are unable to log into Lucidworks Platform, contact Support or your Lucidworks representative.
     </Warning>


   * Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** provided by your Okta OIDC application.
   * Enter the **Configuration URL** provided by your Okta instance.

     <Tip>
     To get the full OIDC configuration URL, append `/.well-known/openid-configuration` to your Issuer URL. For example, if your issuer is `https://lucidworkstest.oktapreview.com`, the full configuration URL would be: `https://lucidworkstest.oktapreview.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`
     </Tip>


3. Click **Save**.
4. The Identity Provider process may take several minutes to complete. Once finished, the **URLs for IDP Configuration** display on the right side of the screen. Copy the **Redirect URL** and save it in a secure location.

## 4. Configure the application in Okta

1. In Okta, navigate to the application you created for Lucidworks SSO.
2. In the General Settings, click **Edit**.
3. In **Sign-in redirect URIs** click **Add URI**. Paste the **Redirect URL** generated by Lucidworks Platform.
4. Click **Save**.

## 5. Test SSO functionality

After configuring both Identity Provider and the application, test the integration by attempting to log into Lucidworks Platform with one of the users assigned to the application. If the configuration is successful, you are prompted to log in with your Okta authentication.

## SAML authentication

[SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language) is an XML-based protocol that uses HTTP to authenticate and authorize user data. In a SAML workflow, Lucidworks Platform is the Relying Party (RP) that requests and receives SAML assertions from the identity provider.

## 1. Create users in Lucidworks Platform

<Tip>
**Important**


Prerequisites

1. Users must be added to the Lucidworks Platform.
2. Users must exist in your OKTA instance, and be enabled for the OKTA application you are using to connect with Lucidworks Platform.
3. The user’s email address in OKTA and Lucidworks Platform must match.

</Tip>



1. Sign in to [Lucidworks Platform](https://platform.lucidworks.com) and click **Settings > Users & Provisioning > Users**.
2. Verify all necessary users are listed, active, and their emails match their Okta user counterparts.
3. If any users are missing, add the appropriate users by completing the steps in [invite users](/lw-platform/platform/00j8nx/users-and-provisioning#invite-users).

## 2. Create a new application in Okta

1. Set up a [new application in Okta](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/apps/apps_app_integration_wizard_saml.htm). There are a few settings specific to setting up an integration with Lucidworks:

   * **Sign-in method**: Select **SAML 2.0**.
   * **Single Sign On URL (ACS URL)**: Enter a placeholder URL for now. You’ll configure it in a later step.
   * **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)**: Enter a placeholder URL for now. You’ll configure it in a later step.
   * **Name ID Format**: Select the appropriate Name ID format. This is usually `EmailAddress`.
   * **Application username**: Choose how Okta should map the user’s application username. For example, their Okta username or email address.
2. After creating the OIDC app, go to the Sign On tab, copy the **Metadata URL**, and save it in a secure location.

   <Tip>
   **Important**
   The **Metadata URL** is critical for SAML communication and must be kept secure.
   </Tip>


3. Assign at least one user and one admin to the application. These users must already exist in Lucidworks Platform. You must assign yourself as one of the users to be able to complete the authentiation configuration.

## 3. Create the Identity Provider in Lucidworks Platform

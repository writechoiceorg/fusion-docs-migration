This type of Fusion integration lets you connect self-hosted Fusion instances to the Lucidworks Configuration Promotion tool.

You must satisfy the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) and complete all of the procedures in the order described in this topic to implement the Lucidworks Configuration Promotion tool.

1. [Create a GitHub token for configuration promotion](#create-a-github-token-for-configuration-promotion)
2. [Set up GitHub branch protection (optional)](#set-up-github-branch-protection-optional)
3. [Configure the integration](#configure-the-integration)
4. [Create a Fusion security JWT realm](#create-a-fusion-security-jwt-realm)
5. [Verify the Configuration Promotion tool integration with Fusion](#verify-the-configuration-promotion-tool-integration-with-fusion)

<Tip>

This topic is specific to integrating the Lucidworks Platform with Fusion for the use of the Configuration Promotion tool.

* To configure a general integration for Lucidworks Platform with Fusion, follow the procedures in [Fusion integrations](/lw-platform/platform/04gi1q/fusion-integrations).
* To configure an integration that uses Lucidworks Commerce Studio, follow the procedures in the [Commerce Studio integration with Fusion](/lw-platform/platform/zpqyc5/commerce-studio-integration) topic.
* To configure a self-hosted Fusion integration with Lucidworks AI, follow the procedures in [Lucidworks AI integrations](/lw-platform/platform/mdlec0/lucidworks-ai-integrations).

</Tip>



## Prerequisites

To create an integration, you must have the following prerequisites in place:

* Admin privileges to a self-hosted Fusion environment running Fusion 5.9.8 or later.
* A Fusion application that contains usable data.
* Workspace Owner permissions in a Lucidworks Platform environment.

## 1. Create a GitHub token for configuration promotion

To set up the Configuration Promotion tool, you must generate a GitHub token.

1. Sign in to GitHub with an account that has access to the integrated systems repository.
2. In GitHub, click your profile icon, and then click **Settings**.
3. Navigate to **Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Tokens (classic)**.
4. Click **Generate new token** and then select **Generate new token (classic)**.
5. In the **Note** field, enter details about the token.
6. In the **Expiration** field, select the period of time the token is active. Lucidworks recommends configuring a long duration in line with your organization’s security pratices. You must generate and configure a new token for your Fusion integration every time your token expires.
7. In the **Select scopes** section, select the **repo** checkbox. This ensures the token has all required permissions.
8. Click **Generate token**.
9. Copy the generated token and save it in a secure location.

<Note>
Your GitHub organization may need to authorize your token.
</Note>



For more information, see [Managing your personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

## 2. Set up GitHub branch protection (optional)

Lucidworks recommends enabling GitHub branch protection for your production (PROD) branch. This protects a branch with requested changes from being promoted until that request has been reviewed.

To configure branch protections, see [About protected branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches).

The configuration promotion tool looks at GitHub to see if the branch is ready to merge. The tool can integrate with any GitHub automations that change the merge-ready status of the branch.

## 3. Configure the integration

Complete the following steps to create an integration for the Lucidworks Configuration Promotion tool with Fusion.

1. Sign into [Lucidworks Platform](https://platform.lucidworks.com) as a workspace owner.
2. Navigate to **Settings > Fusion Integrations** and click **Connect New Fusion**.
3. In the **Name** field, enter a unique name for the integration. For example, `Lucidworks Demo Dev`.
4. In the **API URL** field, enter the URL of your Fusion instance. For example, `https://FUSION_INSTANCE.com`. Do not enter a path after `.com`.
5. In the **Environment** field, select the Fusion instance environment or use the default of **Development**.
6. Optional: Enter one or more descriptive **Tags** that differentiate multiple integrations.

7. All fields in the **GitHub** section are required if you’re setting up the Configuration Promotion tool.

   1. In the **GitHub Branch URL** field, enter the URL from GitHub for your self-hosted Fusion install. The format is `https://github.com/ORGANIZATION_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/tree/BRANCH_NAME`. For example, `https://github.com/company_name/fusion_install/tree/lucidworks_demo_dev`.
   2. In the **GitHub Token** field, enter the [personal access token](#create-a-github-token-for-configuration-promotion) granted privileges to the GitHub organization linked to your self-hosted Fusion install.
8. Click the **Enable Fusion Configuration Promotion** field to **ON** to allow files or instances to be promoted from development to a staging or production environment.

9. Click **Add**. If the value in the **API URL** field is:

   * Not valid, the integration is not created, and it is not displayed on the Fusion Integrations screen.
   * Valid, the Instructions to Connect with Fusion screen displays:

     <Frame>![Connect with Fusion](/assets/images/lw-platform/integrations/lw-platform-integrations-connect-jwt-values.png)</Frame>
10. Copy both the **JWK Set URL** value and the **Issuer URL** value to a secure location. These values must be used to create the [Create a Fusion security JWT realm for Lucidworks Platform](#create-a-fusion-security-jwt-realm-for-lucidworks-platform).
11. Click **Close**.
12. Verify the new integration displays on the Fusion Integrations screen.

<Note>
To edit the integration, hold the pointer over the integration, click the pencil icon, enter the changes, and click **Save**. To delete the integration, hold the pointer over the integration and click the trash can icon.
</Note>



## 4. Create a Fusion security JWT realm

To complete required fields in the integration, you must create a Fusion security realm.

1. Sign in to your Fusion instance as an admin and click the Fusion application to connect with the Lucidworks Configuration Promotion tool.
2. Navigate to **System > Access Control > Security Realms** and click **Add Security Realm**.
3. In the **Name** field, enter a unique connection name. For example, **Lucidworks Configuration Promotion tool JWT realm**.
4. In the **Type** field, select **jwt**.
5. Set the checkboxes in the following configuration.

   * Select the **Enabled** checkbox.
   * Do not select the **Ephemeral Users** checkbox.
   * Select the **Auto-Create Users** checkbox.
6. In the **Roles** field, select the roles that this realm provides after successfully authenticating a user by default.
7. In the **JWT Issuer** field, paste the **Issuer URL** value generated in the [Configure the integration](#configure-the-integration) procedure.
8. In the **JWK Set URL** field, paste the **JWKS URL** value generated in the [Configure the integration](#configure-the-integration) procedure.
9. Do not enter values (default is blank) in any of the following fields:

   * **Signing Key**
   * **Groups Key**
   * **Groups Mapping**
   * **User ID Attribute**
10. Click **Save**.

## 5. Verify the Configuration Promotion tool integration with Fusion

When the Fusion security JWT realm is created, complete the following steps to verify the Fusion information is displayed.

1. Sign into [Lucidworks Platform](https://platform.lucidworks.com) as a workspace owner.
2. Navigate to **Settings > Fusion Integrations**.
3. Hold the pointer over the integration and click the pencil icon.
4. Verify the information is accurate.

   <Note>
   The information in the Instructions section must match the values in the **Additional URLs JWKS URL** and **Issuer URL** fields.
   </Note>

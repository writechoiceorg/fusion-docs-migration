The Fusion screen in Lucidworks Platform is where you can view your Fusion instances and perform promotions between environments. For Managed Fusion clients, Lucidworks sets up and configure Fusion integrations for Lucidworks Platform. Self-hosted Fusion clients must set up [Fusion integrations](/lw-platform/platform/04gi1q/fusion-integrations) to view their Fusion instances here.

## Fusion instances

The Fusion Instances tab displays by default. Your Fusion instances contain the following information:

* **Self Hosted** or **Managed** labels indicate the type of Fusion deployment.
* [Environment](/managed-fusion/5.9/zm43ol/environments) labels indicate the type of Fusion environment, such as **Dev**, **Staging**, and **Prod**.

Based on your user permissions, you can perform the following actions related to your Fusion instances:

* Click on a Fusion instance tile to access the sign in page.
* (Managed Fusion only) Click the three dots in the corner of your Fusion instance, then click **View Metrics** to display your [Customer Dashboard](/managed-fusion/5.9/jc151t/customer-dashboard).

## Configuration promotion

This feature is available to Managed Fusion and self-hosted Fusion clients using Fusion 5.9.8 or later.

The Configuration Promotion tool uses a GitHub configuration for every Fusion instance you want to manage.

<Note>
To use this feature, self-hosted Fusion clients must set up [ConfigSync](/fusion/5.9/j47yes/config-sync) and complete all of the procedures described in the [Configuration Promotion tool integration with Fusion](/lw-platform/platform/qjns2v/configuration-promotion-integration) topic.

#### Start promotion

You can promote changes between Fusion environments using the Configuration Promotion tool.

For Managed Fusion clients, promotion requests are reviewed by Lucidworks. You can track the approval status in the Configuration Promotion table.

1. Click **Start Promotion**.
2. In the **Source** section, select the Fusion instance that contains the changes you want to promote. For example, if you’re promoting changes to a Staging environment, select your Dev environment. A file tree appears in the Source section that represents all the Fusion objects within the selected system.
3. Select the checkboxes next to the files that you wish to promote into the target instance.

   <Note>
   Some files are restricted and cannot be selected for promotion.
   </Note>


4. In the **Target** section, select the Fusion instance where the changes will be promoted. For example, if you’re promoting changes from a Dev environment, select your Staging environmet. A file tree appears in the Source section that represents all the Fusion objects within the selected system. Verify that you have selected the correct target by reviewing the files you want to change.

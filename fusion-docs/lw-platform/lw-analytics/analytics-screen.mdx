## Types of metrics

The Signals analytics dashboard supports the following metrics:

| Chart name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Abandoned Cart Rate | Measures the percentage of shopping carts that are created but not converted into purchases. This metric is crucial for understanding issues in the checkout process. |
| Add to Cart Rate | Measures the percentage of clicks that result in an item being added to the shopping cart. This metric highlights the effectiveness of product pages and user readiness to purchase. For example, a cart add rate of 2.0% indicates that for every 100 product clicks, 2 items are added to the cart. Monitoring this metric can help identify areas where improvements in product descriptions, images, or pricing strategies could drive better results. |
| Average Order Value | Displays the average price value of orders for the selected time period. This metric is crucial for understanding how much revenue is generated per order, which helps in evaluating pricing strategies and customer spending behavior. |
| Conversion Rate | Measures the effectiveness of a website, campaign, or action in achieving a specific goal, such as purchases, sign-ups, or downloads. It reflects how well you convert visitors or actions into successful outcomes. |
| Facet Usage | Measures facet usage over time for the given period. Shows how many of each facet were selected for the given period. |
| Queries with Zero Results | List of query terms that were searched and yielded no results the most frequently. |
| Revenue Per Visitor | Average revenue generated by each visitor to your site over time, for the given period. It is a combination metric of conversion rate and average order value. Arguably the most important metric in assessing the performance of an ecommerce site. |
| Search Add to Cart Rate | Measures the percentage of users who add a product to their cart after finding it through the site’s search function. A high search add-to-cart rate indicates that the search function is successfully leading users to products they are interested in. |
| Search Click Through Rate | Measures the percentage of users who click on a search result after performing a query. This metric is a direct indicator of how well your search results align with user intent and the relevance of your content. A high CTR suggests that users find the results appealing and useful. |
| Search Conversion Rate | Measures the percentage of searches that result in a completed purchase. This metric represents the final step in the user journey from query to conversion, offering a clear indicator of overall search effectiveness and customer satisfaction. |
| Search Exit Rate | The percentage of traffic that does not take positive action after using search for the given duration. A positive action is defined as a click, add-to-cart, or purchase action. |
| Top Performing Products | Products with the most views and the highest conversions. This metric is useful for understanding which products lead to engagement and conversions. |
| Top Search Terms | Shows the terms or phrases searched most often over the selected time period. It also provides the corresponding click rate, cart rate, purchase rate, and revenue, helping you identify high-performing queries and trends in user interest. |
| Total Searches | Shows the total number of searches over the selected time period. This metric highlights user engagement with the search functionality and can guide improvements in content and indexing. |
| Underperforming Products | Products with the most clicks but lowest conversions (greater than 0). Useful for identifying products that may need attention beyond superficial product information, such as description, images, reviews, and ratings. |
| Zero Result Search Rate | Displays the average percentage of searches that returned zero results for the selected time period. This metric helps you identify gaps in content or product availability. |

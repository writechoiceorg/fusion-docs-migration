Analytics Studio is a service that receives the [signals](/lw-platform/analytics/0le96f/signals) collected by the [signals beacon](/lw-platform/analytics/k649vy/signals-beacon), and collates the metrics into graphs that provide insights about user actions on your site. Information on the graphs include business metrics, query metrics, user behavior insights, and user action metrics.

For more information about viewing the consolidated metrics, see [Analytics Studio metrics](/lw-platform/analytics/xcd2n5/metrics).

## Basics of Analytics Studio

Site analytics is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data in your digital marketplace to understand customer needs, optimize the shopping experience, and drive growth. It lets you make informed decisions and adapt quickly to changes in consumer behavior and trends in user interactions.

Analytics Studio applies the concepts of site analytics to your search experience to gain insights into product performance and how search settings influence customer behavior. These search analytics include metrics that can help you make data-driven decisions to enhance sales, optimize search result layouts, and improve the customer experience.

Analytics Studio collects data about user (visitor) searches, browsing, facet usage, conversions, and more with the [signals beacon](/lw-platform/analytics/k649vy/signals-beacon). The signals beacon is an HTML code snippet, also known as a tracking pixel, that can be added to your site. After you customize the signals beacon for your search experience, the beacon is used to collect query, click, cart-add, purchase, and facet usage signals to generate a larger picture view of performance and behavior.

* Combine conversion rates and order values to assess the revenue per visit (RPV) as a way to evaluate the overall shopping experience.

**Query performance:**

2. Set up a [signals store](/lw-platform/analytics/88pjp2/signals-store) on the Analytics Studio screen.
3. Install and configure the [signals beacon](/lw-platform/analytics/k649vy/signals-beacon) HTML snippet to capture behavioral data such as search queries, clicks, purchases, and facets. In addition, you can tailor the tracking parameters in the signals beacon configuration.
4. Select your signals store to access the Analytics metrics dashboard.

6. Customize dashboards and reports to align with KPIs and business goals, such as search performance metrics, product trends, and customer behavior insights on the [Analytics metrics screen](/lw-platform/analytics/xcd2n5/metrics).

## Combine Analytics Studio with Commerce Studio

Using [Analytics Studio with Commerce Studio](/lw-platform/analytics/kvidem/analytics-studio-and-commerce-studio) enhances your ability to measure, monitor, and optimize search and merchandising strategies.

Analytics Studio processes user behavior data captured by the signals beacon and then Commerce Studio uses this data to assist merchandisers with search and browse rules.
Insights from Analytics Studio can provide information about potential rule adjustments in Commerce Studio, such as boosting underperforming products or burying irrelevant results for specific products or categories.

Analytics Studio provides actionable insights by leveraging signals data from your search application. These signals capture essential metrics that reflect the performance and impact of your search experience, helping you measure and optimize its value.

Both merchandisers and data analysts should actively monitor data from Analytics Studio to ensure that decisions about search results and merchandising strategies are informed by actual customer behavior. By leveraging this data, teams can continuously refine their search application to meet business goals and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Key metrics captured by Analytics Studio

Analytics Studio tracks three critical categories of data:

* **Business metrics:** Understand the financial impact of your search application by analyzing metrics like average order value (AOV) and revenue per visitor (RPV).
* **Query metrics:** Evaluate search effectiveness through data such as top search terms, zero search result rate, and queries with zero result.
* **User action metrics:** Monitor customer behavior by analyzing interactions like click through rate and add cart rate.

These metrics collectively provide a comprehensive view of your search quality and the value your search application delivers to your business and customers.

## How Analytics Studio integrates with Commerce Studio

In Commerce Studio, metrics from Analytics Studio can be displayed directly on product cards. This integration enables you to make data-driven decisions when curating your search results.

For instance, RPV (revenue per visitor) can highlight products generating significant revenue but lacking sufficient visibility in search results. Such insights help identify opportunities to boost underperforming high-profit items, ensuring they are prioritized appropriately to maximize revenue potential.

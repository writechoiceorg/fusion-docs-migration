Pages let you create and customize screens that align Commerce Studio with your website’s search experience. These pages are a valuable tool to create, test, and refine how users interact with your site.

To test search scenarios using the pages, you can set up and manage rules in [Ranking Rules](/lw-platform/cs/ravw5k/ranking-rules) and [Visual Editor](/lw-platform/cs/l6f36o/visual-editor). Then, you can test your customer’s search experience in both Visual Editor and [Live Site Simulator](/lw-platform/cs/93f8tp/live-site-simulator).

## Key pages to build

The number and types of pages you build depends on your business and use case.
In general, it’s helpful to create the following pages:

* **A landing page.** What do customers see when they arrive on your website?
* **Category pages.** How are your products organized?
* **Campaign pages.** Does your website have pages for sales, bestselling items, or special promotions?

Experiment with different versions of the same page.
For example, create multiple landing pages to try out new product layouts and see how that affects discoverability.

## Manage pages

To get started working with pages, navigate to the Pages screen.

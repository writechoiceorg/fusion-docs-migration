The Live Site Simulator screen displays what your customers will see and experience if you publish the configuration you are testing. You can test potential page, rule, and query rewrite configurations before you publish to your production site.

<Tip>
**Important**

This screen only allows you to enter text to search. No other fields can be edited. To modify the configuration, you must make changes in [Visual Editor](/lw-platform/cs/l6f36o/index), [Pages](/lw-platform/cs/t968bf/pages), [Ranking Rules](/lw-platform/cs/ravw5k/ranking-rules), and [Rewrite](/lw-platform/cs/5zeagj/rewrite).
</Tip>



To access the Live Site Simulator, click **Preview Live** from the [Visual Editor screen](/lw-platform/cs/l6f36o/index).

When you enter text in the Search field and press **Enter**, the results display your customer experience based on the following configuration.

* [The page you create](/lw-platform/cs/t968bf/pages).
* [The rules you create for the selected page](/lw-platform/cs/ravw5k/ranking-rules).
* [The query rewrite functions such as synonyms and misspelling corrections](/lw-platform/cs/5zeagj/rewrite).

In the following example, the facets display along with the results for "sock".

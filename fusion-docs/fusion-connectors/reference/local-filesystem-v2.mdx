Latest version: v3.1.0

Compatible with Fusion version: 5.1.0 and later

This connector traverses a network file system (NFS), where a shared drive is mounted to the same location on all hosts in the cluster that are running this connector.

## Remote connectors

V2 connectors support [running remotely](/fusion-connectors/8xhsoc/remote-v-2-connectors) in Fusion versions 5.7.1 and later. Refer to [Configure Remote V2 Connectors](/how-to/ssl8ue/configure-remote-v-2-connectors).

Below is an example configuration showing how to specify the file system to index under the `connector-plugins` entry in your `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
additionalVolumes:
- name: fusion-data1-pvc
    persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: fusion-data1-pvc
- name: fusion-data2-pvc
    persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: fusion-data2-pvc
additionalVolumeMounts:
- name: fusion-data1-pvc
    mountPath: "/connector/data1"
- name: fusion-data2-pvc
    mountPath: "/connector/data2"

```

You may also need to specify the user that is authorized to access the file system, as in this example:

```yaml
securityContext:
    fsGroup: 1002100000
    runAsUser: 1002100000

```

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

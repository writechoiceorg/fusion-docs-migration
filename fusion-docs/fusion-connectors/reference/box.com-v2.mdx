Latest version: v2.2.0

Compatible with Fusion version: 5.9.4 and later

The Box connector retrieves data from a Box.com cloud-based data repository. To fetch content from multiple Box users, you must [create a Box app that uses OAuth 2.0 with JWT server authentication](/how-to/900/configure-a-box-com-datasource#Box-Create-App). For limited testing using a single user account, you can [create a Box app that uses Standard OAuth 2.0 authentication](/how-to/739/configure-box-com-tokens#Box-Auth2).

<Tip>
**Important**

The v2.2.0 version of this connector is only compatible with Fusion 5.9.4 and later when using security trimming. The v2.2.0 connector version uses [Graph Security Trimming](/fusion/5.9/zdzlfu/graph-security-trimming-stage) and not regular security trimming. It is imperative to treat this as a new connector, as configurations do not transfer over due to disparities between newer versions and previous ones. A full crawl is mandatory.

## Remote connectors

V2 connectors support [running remotely](/fusion-connectors/8xhsoc/remote-v-2-connectors) in Fusion versions 5.7.1 and later. Refer to [Configure Remote V2 Connectors](/how-to/ssl8ue/configure-remote-v-2-connectors).

Below is an example configuration showing how to specify the file system to index under the `connector-plugins` entry in your `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
additionalVolumes:
- name: fusion-data1-pvc
    persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: fusion-data1-pvc
- name: fusion-data2-pvc
    persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: fusion-data2-pvc
additionalVolumeMounts:
- name: fusion-data1-pvc
    mountPath: "/connector/data1"
- name: fusion-data2-pvc
    mountPath: "/connector/data2"

```

You may also need to specify the user that is authorized to access the file system, as in this example:

```yaml
securityContext:
    fsGroup: 1002100000
    runAsUser: 1002100000

```

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

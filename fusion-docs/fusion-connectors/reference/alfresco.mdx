Compatible with Fusion version: 4.1.0 through 5.12.0

The Alfresco Connector is a crawler for the Alfresco server, which adheres to the
[Content Management Interoperability Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Management_Interoperability_Services) (CMIS) standard.

<Tip>
**Important**

V1 deprecation and removal notice

Starting in Fusion 5.12.0, all V1 connectors are deprecated. This means they are no longer being actively developed and will be removed in Fusion 5.13.0.

The replacement for this connector is using the [Alfresco recipe](/fusion-connectors/6y4vwx/alfresco) with the REST V2 connector.

If you are using this connector, you must migrate to the replacement connector or a supported alternative before upgrading to Fusion 5.13.0. We recommend migrating to the replacement connector as soon as possible to avoid any disruption to your workflows.

</Tip>



This connector was developed for the
[Alfresco Community 5.0d](http://sourceforge.net/projects/alfresco/files/Alfresco%205.0.d%20Community/) content repositories
and was not tested on any other versions of Alfresco or any other CMIS server.

Compatible with Fusion version: 4.0.0 through 5.12.0

The Drupal connector requires **Drupalâ€™s Services 7.x3.11 Module REST API**. Refer to this page to install the necessary packages: [www.drupal.org/node/783236](https://www.drupal.org/node/783236)

<Warning>
**Caution**

This connector is no longer functional in Fusion 5.9 and later. This incompatibility arises due to changes implemented in the data source version or related APIs.

Although the V1 connector might still be visible within the Fusion UI, it cannot be used effectively. To ensure uninterrupted operation, we strongly recommend switching to a valid V2 alternate connector.

The replacement for this connector is in active development at this time and will be released at a future date.

</Warning>



## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

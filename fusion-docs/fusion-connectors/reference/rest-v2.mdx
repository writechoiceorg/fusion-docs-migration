Latest version: v1.1.0

Compatible with Fusion version: 5.9.0 and later

The REST V2 connector is a way to use one connector for multiple datasources. It works with recipes, which are premade JSON configurations.

See the [concept section](/fusion-connectors/e8bakk/rest-v-2-connector) for more information.

An API call is made to the REST V2 connector containing a [recipe](https://github.com/lucidworks/rest-configurations) as the body. API calls to set up the REST V2 connector go through the [Connector Datasources API](/fusion/5.9/353/connector-datasources-api).

This article lists and describes the Fusion properties used by REST V2. The recommended method of populating these fields is through the use of a recipe. For information on how to get a recipe from the public GitHub repository into Fusion, see [How to use REST V2 recipes](/fusion-connectors/h9szba/recipes#howto-recipes).

The REST V2 connector performs a full crawl each time the connectors runs, as incremental crawling is not supported. When changes are made to the source, such as adding, deleting, or modifying content, those changes will reflect in the index after the next crawl is performed. You can check for new documents in the index by navigating to **Querying > Query Workbench** in the Fusion UI.

## Remote connectors

V2 connectors support [running remotely](/fusion-connectors/8xhsoc/remote-v-2-connectors) in Fusion versions 5.7.1 and later. Refer to [Configure Remote V2 Connectors](/how-to/ssl8ue/configure-remote-v-2-connectors).

Below is an example configuration showing how to specify the file system to index under the `connector-plugins` entry in your `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
additionalVolumes:
- name: fusion-data1-pvc
    persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: fusion-data1-pvc
- name: fusion-data2-pvc
    persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: fusion-data2-pvc
additionalVolumeMounts:
- name: fusion-data1-pvc
    mountPath: "/connector/data1"
- name: fusion-data2-pvc
    mountPath: "/connector/data2"

```

You may also need to specify the user that is authorized to access the file system, as in this example:

```yaml
securityContext:
    fsGroup: 1002100000
    runAsUser: 1002100000

```

<Tip>
**Important**

V1 deprecation and removal notice

Starting in Fusion 5.12.0, all V1 connectors are deprecated. This means they are no longer being actively developed and will be removed in Fusion 5.13.0.

The replacement for this connector is in active development at this time and will be released at a future date.

If you are using this connector, you must migrate to the replacement connector or a supported alternative before upgrading to Fusion 5.13.0. We recommend migrating to the replacement connector as soon as possible to avoid any disruption to your workflows.

## Configuration

The **StartLinks** values for this connector must be one of the following:

* `root` to crawl the whole organization or per-user drive.
* A folder ID.

  For example, if your folder’s URL is `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1u0p7N096R6MWgma3gwUj4j` then the start link in the connector configuration should be `0B1u0p7N096R6MWgma3gwUj4j`.
* A document ID.

  For example, if your document’s URL is `https://docs.google.com/document/d/10HRr5gD0OetzgEL9fsyxryf_AfiKqDQ8cn12YXQ/edit` then the start link in the connector configuration should be `10HRr5gD0OetzgEL9fsyxryf_AfiKqDQ8cn12YXQ`.

<Note>
Debugging with HTTP is available in Fusion 4.2.6. You can enable `diagnosticMode` to diagnose an issue with HTTP level traffic logging.
</Note>


<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

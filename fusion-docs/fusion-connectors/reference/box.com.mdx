Compatible with Fusion version: 4.0.0 through 5.2.2

The Box connector retrieves data from a Box.com cloud-based data repository. To fetch content from multiple Box users, you must [create a Box app that uses OAuth 2.0 with JWT server authentication](/how-to/900/configure-a-box-com-datasource#Box-Create-App). For limited testing using a single user account, you can [create a Box app that uses Standard OAuth 2.0 authentication](/how-to/739/configure-box-com-tokens#Box-Auth2).

<Note>

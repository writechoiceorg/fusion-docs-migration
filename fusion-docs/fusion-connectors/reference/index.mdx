Connectors are the conduit between Fusion and your external data sources. Connectors retrieve your data and import it into Fusion.

To ensure compatibility between the connector and your Fusion version, please refer to the Fusion compatibility declaration located at the beginning of each connector configuration reference article. For example:

<Frame>![Fusion Connector compatibility details](/assets/images/connector-compatibility.png)</Frame>

* **Latest version.** This is the latest version of the connector. To check the connector version you’re using, navigate to **System > Blobs**, open the **Connector Plugin** directory, and select the connector. The version value is declared in the **connectorVersion** field.
* **Compatible with Fusion version.** This provides the versions of Fusion that are compatible with the latest version of the connector.

Any additional information about compatibility is included in the body of the connector configuration reference article.

## Installation instructions

Fusion includes all available connectors in **Indexing > Datasources**. Some connectors come pre-installed, but you must install others manually. See the following resources for your version of Fusion:

* [Install a Connector - 5.2 and later](/how-to/8810/install-a-connector-5-2-and-later)
* [Install a Connector - Fusion 5.1](/how-to/8811/install-a-connector-fusion-5-1)
* [Install a Connector - Fusion 4.x](/how-to/8813/install-a-connector-fusion-4-x)

<Tip>
**Important**

Check the connector reference page linked in the table for Fusion compatibility information.

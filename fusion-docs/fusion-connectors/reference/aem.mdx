Latest version: v1.3.0

Compatible with Fusion version: 5.9.4 and later

This connector retrieves data from an Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) repository. The AEM V2 connector is compatible with AEM version 6.5.

For step-by-step configuration instructions, refer to [configure AEM V2 connector](/how-to/ht8hle/configure-aem-v-2-connector).

The AEM V2 connector supports the following:

* Full crawling and recrawling of pages and assets in Adobe Experience Manager.
* Basic authentication.

  <Note>
  In v1.2.0 and Fusion 5.12.0 and later, the username and password fields have moved under **Authentication Settings** > **Login Settings**.
  </Note>


* [OAuth authenticaion](/how-to/ht8hle/aem-connector-oauth-authorization).
* Security trimming, to filter results based on user permissions.
* Filter document crawling by including and excluding paths and configuring content properties when [setting up the connector](/how-to/ht8hle/configure-aem-v-2-connector).
* Specify wait time between fetch requests to throttle crawls, if necessary.
* In Fusion 5.12.0 and later: Optional crawling of child paths.

  <Tip>
  Check for duplicate data when crawling child paths. For example, if the connector indexes both `cq:Page` and `cq:PageContent` then the results could include duplicated data.
  </Tip>



<Tip>
**Important**

The v1.3.0 version of this connector is only compatible with Fusion 5.9.4 and later when using security trimming. The v1.3.0 connector version uses [Graph Security Trimming](/fusion/5.9/zdzlfu/graph-security-trimming-stage) and not regular security trimming. It is imperative to treat this as a new connector, as configurations do not transfer over due to disparities between newer versions and previous ones. A full crawl is mandatory.
</Tip>



## Remote connectors

V2 connectors support [running remotely](/fusion-connectors/8xhsoc/remote-v-2-connectors) in Fusion versions 5.7.1 and later. Refer to [Configure Remote V2 Connectors](/how-to/ssl8ue/configure-remote-v-2-connectors).

Below is an example configuration showing how to specify the file system to index under the `connector-plugins` entry in your `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
additionalVolumes:
- name: fusion-data1-pvc
    persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: fusion-data1-pvc
- name: fusion-data2-pvc
    persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: fusion-data2-pvc
additionalVolumeMounts:
- name: fusion-data1-pvc
    mountPath: "/connector/data1"
- name: fusion-data2-pvc
    mountPath: "/connector/data2"

```

You may also need to specify the user that is authorized to access the file system, as in this example:

```yaml
securityContext:
    fsGroup: 1002100000
    runAsUser: 1002100000

```

Compatible with Fusion version: 4.0.0 through 5.12.0

[Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_design.html).
It traverses the Hadoop file system as it would a regular Unix filesystem.

**Important**

V1 deprecation and removal notice

Starting in Fusion 5.12.0, all V1 connectors are deprecated. This means they are no longer being actively developed and will be removed in Fusion 5.13.0.

The replacement for this connector is in active development at this time and will be released at a future date.

If you are using this connector, you must migrate to the replacement connector or a supported alternative before upgrading to Fusion 5.13.0. We recommend migrating to the replacement connector as soon as possible to avoid any disruption to your workflows.

</Tip>



See also the Hadoop connectors, which use [MapReduce](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/mapred_tutorial.html) to distribute the crawl processes. For Fusion 4.x, see the following connectors reference pages:

* [Apache Hadoop 2](/fusion-connectors/82/apache-hadoop-2)
* [Cloudera](/fusion-connectors/74/cloudera)
* [Hortonworks](/fusion-connectors/40/hortonworks)
* [MapR](/fusion-connectors/22/remote-connectors)

When there is a lot of content to process, these MapReduce-enabled connectors will be significantly faster.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

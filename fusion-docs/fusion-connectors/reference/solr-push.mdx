Compatible with Fusion version: 4.2.0 through 5.1.5

The Solr Push Endpoint accepts documents and pushes them to Solr using the Fusion index pipelines.
You might use this, for example, if you are indexing Solr XML documents from a content management system that natively integrates with Solr, for example using SolrJ.

The Solr Push Endpoint requires you to define a port that is not already in use by another process. You can then send the documents to Fusion at that port.

For a more general purpose method of pushing documents into Fusion, see
[Importing Data with the REST API](/how-to/865/import-data-with-the-rest-api).

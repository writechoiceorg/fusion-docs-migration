Compatible with Fusion version: 4.0.0 through 5.12.0

The Dropbox connector retrieves data from a Dropbox cloud-based data repository.

<Tip>
**Important**

V1 deprecation and removal notice

Starting in Fusion 5.12.0, all V1 connectors are deprecated. This means they are no longer being actively developed and will be removed in Fusion 5.13.0.

The replacement for this connector is in active development at this time and will be released at a future date.

If you are using this connector, you must migrate to the replacement connector or a supported alternative before upgrading to Fusion 5.13.0. We recommend migrating to the replacement connector as soon as possible to avoid any disruption to your workflows.

</Tip>


<Note>
This connector is not available in Fusion 4.1.x.
</Note>



To fetch content from Dropbox, you must have an OAuth token accessible to the crawler so it can properly authenticate.

If you want to crawl all of the files owned by the account, you can simply use `/` as the `startLink`.

The `startLink` for a folder is its share link:

* In the Dropbox Web UI, navigate to the folder and then to **Share Folder** > **Share with Dropbox** > **Create Link** (or **Copy Link** if the link has already been created).
* In the Dropbox integration for the Finder in OS X , select the folder, right-click, and select **Copy Dropbox Link**.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

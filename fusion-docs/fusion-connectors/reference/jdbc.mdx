Compatible with Fusion version: 4.0.0 through 5.3.5

The JDBC connector fetches documents from a relational database via SQL queries. Under the hood, this connector implements the Solr [DataImportHandler (DIH)](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/DataImportHandler) plugin.

<Note>

Deprecation and removal notice

This connector is deprecated as of Fusion 5.3 and is removed or expected to be removed as of Fusion 5.4. Use the JDBC V2 connector instead.

For more information about deprecations and removals, including possible alternatives, see [Deprecations and Removals](/fusion-connectors/ft39rr/deprecations-and-removals).

</Note>



## Date field types

Observe the date field type in the source database. Delta queries compare a date in the source database to the time of the most recent data import. The user selects a date field from their database to use for comparison (for example, a field like `last_updated`). The field type changes the behavior of the comparison:

* DATE: It compares the day (for example, 2020-02-20)
* TIMESTAMP: It compares both the day and time (for example, 2020-02-20 17:45:45)

Note: When using a primary key other than `id`, remove `UUIDUpdateProcessorFactory` from `solrconfig.xml`. Also change the `uniqueKey` value in `schema.xml` to your primary key.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

Deprecation and removal notice

This connector is deprecated as of Fusion 4.2 and is removed or expected to be removed as of Fusion 5.0. Due to a dependency issue, the Couchbase V1 connector does not work as expected in Fusion 4.2. Use the Couchbase V2 connector instead.

This connector has been tested for compatibility with Couchbase Server 2.5.1 Enterprise Edition.

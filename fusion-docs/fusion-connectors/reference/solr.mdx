Compatible with Fusion version: 4.0.0 through 5.12.0

A Solr connector pulls documents from an external standalone Solr instance or SolrCloud cluster using
Solrâ€™s [javabin](http://wiki.apache.org/solr/javabin) response type and streaming response parser.

<Tip>
**Important**

V1 deprecation and removal notice

Starting in Fusion 5.12.0, all V1 connectors are deprecated. This means they are no longer being actively developed and will be removed in Fusion 5.13.0.

The replacement for this connector is in active development at this time and will be released at a future date.

If you are using this connector, you must migrate to the replacement connector or a supported alternative before upgrading to Fusion 5.13.0. We recommend migrating to the replacement connector as soon as possible to avoid any disruption to your workflows.

</Tip>



For Solr v4.7 and greater, cursorMark deep-paging is used. For earlier versions of Solr, standard paging (start+rows) is used.

The following Solr components and parameters can be configured:

* collection/core (also allows default/empty core)
* query (*:* by default)
* filter queries
* query parser
* request handler (defaults to /select)
* stored fields to retrieve

Also, since cursorMark deep paging should be used when possible:

* sort spec (default: id asc)

This connector can be configured to store information about datasources and the data ingested in a ConnectorDB crawldb instance.

## Limitations

* Cannot do incremental crawls. (May be possible to do so in the future using source Solr docs' version field.)
* Cannot do manual filtered deep paging.
* Does not check that both sort spec and field list contain uniqueKey field.
* Cannot handle encrypted connection to Solr.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

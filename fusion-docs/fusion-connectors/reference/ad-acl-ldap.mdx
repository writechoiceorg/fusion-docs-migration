Latest version: v2.1.1

Compatible with Fusion version: 5.9.1 and later

The Active Directory Connector for ACLs indexes Access Control List (ACL) information so that it can be used by other connectors.

<Note>

Verify your connector version

This connector depends on specific Fusion versions. See the following table for the required versions:

| Fusion version | Connector version |
| --- | --- |
| Fusion 5.6.1 and later | v1.0.0 and later |
| Fusion 5.9.0 and later | v1.5.0 and later |
| Fusion 5.9.1 and later | v2.0.0 and later |

For connector downloads, see [Download Connectors](/fusion-connectors/n0s114/download-connectors). For instructions on installing a connector, see [Install a Connector](/how-to/8810/install-a-connector-5-2-and-later).

</Note>


<Warning>

Pod limit

The LDAP ACLs V2 connector does not support running multiple instances. Donâ€™t run the connector on more than one pod.

</Warning>



## Full recrawls

Starting in Fusion 5.7, subsequent crawls work differently with the LDAP ACLs V2 connector than other connectors. Crawls follow this process:

1. Every time the connector crawl runs, all documents are indexed.
2. Each document is assigned a new field, `_lw_job_id_s`.
3. The connector job assigns the `jobID` value to this field.
4. When the crawl finishes, the job deletes documents that do not have the latest `jobID` value.

## Remote connectors

You can configure the LDAP ACLs V2 connector (v2.0.0 and later) to [running remotely](/fusion-connectors/8xhsoc/remote-v-2-connectors) in Fusion versions 5.9.1 and later. Refer to [Configure Remote V2 Connectors](/how-to/ssl8ue/configure-remote-v-2-connectors).

## Security trimming

Starting in Fusion 5.9, you can configure the LDAP ACLs V2 connector with the [SharePoint Optimized V2 connector](/fusion-connectors/3qqudu/share-point-optimized-v-2) to support security trimming. Refer to [Configure Security Trimming for SharePoint Optimized V2](/how-to/hjbv7z/configure-security-trimming-for-share-point-optimized-v-2).

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

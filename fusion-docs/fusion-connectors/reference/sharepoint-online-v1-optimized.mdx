Compatible with Fusion version: 4.2.4 through 4.2.6

The SharePoint Online V1 Optimized connector retrieves data from cloud-based SharePoint repositories. Authentication requires a Sharepoint user who has permissions to access Sharepoint via the SOAP API. This user must be registered with the Sharepoint Online authentication server; it is not necessarily the same as the user in Active Directory or LDAP.

<Note>

Deprecation and removal notice

This connector is deprecated as of Fusion 4.2 and is removed or expected to be removed as of Fusion 5.0. Use the SharePoint Optimized V2 connector instead.

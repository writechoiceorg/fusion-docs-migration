Compatible with Fusion version: 4.2.6 through 4.2.6

The Active Directory Connector for ACLs indexes Access Control List (ACL) information into a configured "sidecar" Solr collection, so that it can be used by other connectors.

For information on using the collection, see [Use The Active Directory ACL Collection (V1)](/how-to/842/use-the-active-directory-acl-collection-v-1).

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

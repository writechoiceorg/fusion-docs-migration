**Important**

V1 deprecation and removal notice

Starting in Fusion 5.12.0, all V1 connectors are deprecated. This means they are no longer being actively developed and will be removed in Fusion 5.13.0.

The replacement for this connector is in active development at this time and will be released at a future date.

If you are using this connector, you must migrate to the replacement connector or a supported alternative before upgrading to Fusion 5.13.0. We recommend migrating to the replacement connector as soon as possible to avoid any disruption to your workflows.

</Tip>



At the first connection, the Fusion MongoDB connector crawls the entire MongoDB and saves the checkpoint.

If **Process oplog** is not selected, when you restart the data source, the connector recrawls the entire MongoDB.
In this mode the connector does not support incremental recrawling, nor does it delete entries that are deleted from MongoDB.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

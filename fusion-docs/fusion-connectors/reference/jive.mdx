V1 deprecation and removal notice

Starting in Fusion 5.12.0, all V1 connectors are deprecated. This means they are no longer being actively developed and will be removed in Fusion 5.13.0.

The replacement for this connector is in active development at this time and will be released at a future date.

If you are using this connector, you must migrate to the replacement connector or a supported alternative before upgrading to Fusion 5.13.0. We recommend migrating to the replacement connector as soon as possible to avoid any disruption to your workflows.

</Tip>



If security trimming is enabled, the Jive connector uses the `visibility` field while indexing permission metadata on content. This data is stored in the `acl_ss` field for each document.

The value of the `visibility` field determines the permissions assigned to a document. The following table describes how the types of permissions found in the `visibility` field of a document are used.

| Permission type | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| All | The value stored in the `acl_ss` field is "all". |
| People | The document includes a list of users who are authorized to view the content. This list is stored in the `acl_ss` field as user email addresses. |
| Place | A request is made to determine the type of group. The group type determines the permissions stored. |
| Open or Members Only | The value stored in the `acl_ss` field is "all". |
| Private or Secret | The value stored in the `acl_ss` field is the name of the group. |

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

Compatible with Fusion version: 4.0.0 through 5.12.0

The GitHub connector retrieves data from GitHub repositories using
the [GitHub REST API](https://developer.github.com/v3/).

<Tip>
**Important**

V1 deprecation and removal notice

Starting in Fusion 5.12.0, all V1 connectors are deprecated. This means they are no longer being actively developed and will be removed in Fusion 5.13.0.

The replacement for this connector is in active development at this time and will be released at a future date.

If you are using this connector, you must migrate to the replacement connector or a supported alternative before upgrading to Fusion 5.13.0. We recommend migrating to the replacement connector as soon as possible to avoid any disruption to your workflows.

</Tip>



GitHub repository access needs authentication, in which case GitHub oAuth token Authentication will be used to perform GitHub requests. See the [GitHub oAuth Authentication](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line#creating-a-token) page for more information.

<Tip>
The GitHub API service implements [rate limiting](https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting). If you repeatedly crawl the commits in a large or old repository, this can trigger a temporary lockout. For this reason, Lucidworks recommends creating a separate GitHub user specifically for Fusionâ€™s GitHub connector.

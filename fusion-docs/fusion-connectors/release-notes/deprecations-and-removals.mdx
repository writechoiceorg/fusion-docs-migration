This article lists connectors that have been deprecated and are removed or expected to be removed in the future. A deprecated connector is no longer actively maintained or supported by Lucidworks.

For updates on connectors, including deprecations and removals, read the [Fusion Connectors Release Notes](/fusion-connectors/4/release-notes) and [Fusion Release Notes](/fusion/5.9/97/release-notes).

## V1 connectors

V1 connectors are deprecated and removed by Fusion version. The following table shows the deprecation and removal schedule for V1 connectors. Unreleased Fusion versions indicate the connector is expected to be removed at that time.

<Tip>
**Important**

V1 deprecation notice

Starting in Fusion 5.12.0, all V1 connectors will be deprecated. This means they are no longer being actively developed and will be removed in Fusion 5.13.0. Please note:

* **Some V1 connectors already have a direct replacement available.** You can find the replacement connector in the following table.
* **For other V1 connectors, a replacement is still under development.** We will update the documentation when the replacement is available.

If you are using a V1 connector, you must migrate to the replacement connector or a supported alternative before upgrading to Fusion 5.13.0. We recommend migrating to the replacement connector as soon as possible to avoid any disruption to your workflows.

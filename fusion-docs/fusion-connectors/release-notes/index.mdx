Fusion Connectors are continuously improving with new features, updated functionality, performance upgrades, and bug fixes. This article summarizes these changes.

## July 2025

### July 9, 2025 - Web V2 v2.1.0

The [Web V2 connector](/fusion-connectors/tq6l3z/web-v-2) has been updated to version 2.1.0.

This release adds JavaScript evaluation for the Web V2 connector, which allows the connector to extract content from a website that is only available after JavaScript has been rendered. The release also rebuilds some of the connector’s capabilities in Selenium Grid, which offers non-headless browser mode and concurrent processing. Additionally, this release restores features from the Web V1 connector.

<Tip>
**Important**

If you are using Web V2 2.1.0 or later, you must use Selenium Grid as part of your Web V2 connector setup.
</Tip>



#### JavaScript evaluation

JavaScript evaluation is available for remote and hosted connectors and supports authentication and headless browsing. The capabilities of a browser are essential, and this release introduces Selenium Grid to implement browser-based rendering.

For hosted connectors, Selenium Grid support is available through Kubernetes. For remote connectors, Selenium Grid support is available through Docker Compose. See [the Web V2 remote support repository](https://github.com/lucidworks/web-v2-remote-support/) for setup instructions and YAML files.

The Selenium services require an x86 architecture to run properly. Running the Selenium services on an ARM-based system such as Apple Silicon is not supported.

<Tip>
**Important**

Up to three Web V2 connectors can run simultaneously in a single cluster. This prevents reaching a max concurrency limit per Web V2 connector, which affects how much data can be sent to Selenium Grid at one time.
</Tip>



If you are authenticating to your website when crawling it, you can evaluate JavaScript while crawling websites. Select **Evaluate JavaScript during SmartForms/SAML Login**.

The headless browsing setting in the Web V2 connector lets you runs browsers without actually seeing the browser. For websites that render pages on the server, the **Headless browser** field must be unchecked for the crawl to work correctly and retrieve links. For websites that render pages on the client side, the **Headless browser** field should be checked.

#### Improvements

The `depth` property has been restored, allowing you to control the scope of your web crawl. The default value is `-1`, which does not limit the scope of the crawl. Configure this value in the **Limit Document Properties** section of the Web V2 connector.

If a crawl fails because the start link is invalid, the Web V2 connector now marks the crawl as failed and Fusion logs an exception. This restores functionality from the Web V1 connector.

#### Bug fix

Previously, the Port field for Basic Authentication did not accept `-1` as a value to accept any port. This is now resolved, and `-1` is an accepted value.

## April 2025

### April 24, 2025 - Web V2 v2.0.1

The [Web V2 connector](/fusion-connectors/tq6l3z/web-v-2) has been updated to version 2.0.1.

* Fixed a bug where Web V2 v2.0.0 failed to handle non-HTML responses such as JSON. When a JSON response was returned, the connector would complete with a success resposne but without indexing any data due to a premature stream closure error. This issue occurred only with Web V2 v2.0.0 on Fusion 5.9.11 and did not affect Web V2 v1.4.0.
* Compatibility for this connector is extended to include all versions of Fusion 5.9.x.

### April 9, 2025 - Amazon S3 V2 v1.4.2

The [AWS S3 V2 connector](/fusion-connectors/8851/amazon-aws-s-3-v-2) is updated to v1.4.2.

This release resolves a bug where recrawls failed to fetch data from folders. This occurred when a previous crawl saved errors in Crawldb and the **datasourceConfig** had:

* `objectKeys` configured
* `enableStrayContent` set to `false`

## March 2025

### March 31, 2025 - Web V2 v2.0.0

The [Web V2 connector](/fusion-connectors/tq6l3z/web-v-2) has been updated to version 2.0.0. This release resolves a critical issue where the **Restrict crawl to start-link** checkbox appeared unchecked in the UI, while the setting was enabled in the backend. This discrepancy caused the option to be enforced even when the UI indicated it was disabled, potentially resulting in the indexing job failing silently.

This release also includes general performance and compatibility improvements.

Known issues in version 2.0.0:

* The **Link rewrite script** option, which allows JavaScript to modify document links before fetching, is currently non-functional. A fix is planned for a future release.
* The **Max items** setting enforces a limit that is one less than the configured value. For example, if set to 10,000, only 9,999 documents are fetched. A fix is planned for a future release.

<Tip>
**Important**

Starting with Fusion 5.9.11, you must upgrade to the Web V2 connector v2.0.0 or later. Previous versions (e.g. 1.4.0) are incompatible with Fusion 5.9.11 and later versions of Fusion 5.9 due to changes introduced by the upgraded JDK in Fusion. If you are using an earlier version of Fusion, use Web V2 v1.4.0 instead.

</Tip>



## March 3, 2025 - JDBC V2 v2.6.2

The [JDBC V2 Connector](/fusion-connectors/8850/jdbc-v-2) is updated to v2.6.2.

This release resolves a bug that caused some updated or newly added records to be missed during delta indexing.

Previously, the connector only looked at the end time of the last indexing job to find new data. This behavior meant any records added or changed during that job could be skipped during delta indexing.

With this fix, the connector now looks at both the start and end times of the last job, ensuring that no records are missed when running a delta indexing job.

## January 2025

### January 30, 2025 - REST V2 v1.1.0

The [REST V2 connector](/fusion-connectors/e8bakk/rest-v-2-connector) is upgraded to v1.1.0.

#### Summary

A recipe is added for Alfresco to enhance the search experience by implementing a hierarchical request feature that traverses multiple storage levels to locate and index file content. Several new features are added, including introducing a retry mechanism to reattempt requests failing due to server-side errors based on configurable retry counts and delay times. Additionally, this release features a skip indexation option that prevents indexing parent objects when they are only used to discover child objects. The connector now supports recursive requests to automatically retrieve nested objects regardless of depth. This release also allows for limiting documents through exclusion by regular expressions and file size constraints, and includes improvements like enhanced logging with query parameters and the addition of an index field to track the number of documents indexed per request configuration.

#### New recipe

* A new recipe is included as part of this release: [Alfresco](/fusion-connectors/6y4vwx/alfresco).
* This new recipe integrates with the Alfresco information management software improve to improve the search experience.
* The recipe implements the new hierarchical request feature to locate and index file content at multiple storage levels.

#### New features

##### Hierarchical request feature:

* Hierarchical object discovery allows requests to traverse multiple levels by following the natural structure of the data under the source.

Retry feature is added to enable retrying requests if they fail due to a server-side error:

* Retry Count: The number of attempts a request will be retried.
* Max Delay Time: The maximum wait time in milliseconds between retries.

##### Skip indexation of objects feature

* When enabled, the response is not indexed. This is useful when objects are requested only to discover their child objects without indexing the parent object.
* Example indexing a list of files with their binary content:

  + Given a parent request (`objectType=FILE`), retrieve a list of file metadata. This request helps discover the IDs of files to be downloaded in a follow-up request.
  + Given a child request (`objectType=FILE-DOWNLOAD` with `parentObjectType=FILE`), download the binary content from previously discovered file metadata.
  + The indexed documents will include file metadata (from the `FILE` request) joined with binary content (from the `FILE-DOWNLOAD` request).
  + Enable **Skip Indexation** in `FILE` request to prevent indexing file metadata objects.

##### Recursive requests

* Enables recursive retrieval of nested objects of the same `ObjectType` using the same request configuration. This is useful when the depth of nesting is unknown, automating the retrieval of all nested objects.
* Example: Detect all nested folders from a system path where the depth of nested folders is unknown. Enable **Recursive Requests** to retrieve all levels automatically.

##### Limit documents

* **Exclude by RegEx** allows specifying a list of key-value pairs to exclude objects from indexing.

  + **Key** references the field name of the object to exclude and supports `JsonPath` expressions for navigating nested objects (for example, `objects.nested.path`).
  + **Value** is a regular expression matched against the field value in the object. If the match succeeds, then the entire object is excluded.
* **Exclude by File Size** allows setting minimum and maximum file sizes (in bytes) to exclude files outside the specified range.

  + **Key** references the field name of the object containing the file size and supports `JsonPath` expressions (for example, `objects.nested.path`).
  + **Minimum File Size**: Files smaller than this value will be excluded.
  + **Maximum File Size**: Files larger than this value will be excluded. (Set to `-1` for no limit.)

#### Improvements

* Improved logging to include query parameters in requests.
* Added index field `_lw_rest_object_type_s` to store the value of the `ObjectType` configuration property, which represents the name of the request. This helps track the number of documents indexed per request configuration.

#### Deprecation

* Property `Service Endpoints` used for object discovery through two-level requests is deprecated. Instead, use `List of Requests Configuration` for configuring multiple request levels.

## December 2024

### December 20, 2024 - REST V2 v1.0.0

The [REST V2 connector](/fusion-connectors/e8bakk/rest-v-2-connector) is introduced as a way to enable users to crawl content by exposing its data through a REST API. It can be configured to communicate with a wide selection of external datasources by making API calls and indexing the responses. As an out-of-the-box V2 connector, it provides a low-code user experience for indexing data from REST API-compatible sources.

The REST V2 connector expedites setting up and indexing various datasources using premade configurations, called recipes. These recipes are templates that include all required parameters for datasource integration and can be easily adjusted to suit your specific needs. Unlike single-purpose connectors, the REST V2 connector can index data from any datasource supported by a corresponding recipe.

* The REST V2 Connector relies on a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/lucidworks/rest-configurations) to store and manage recipes. Recipes are open-source and accessible to the community for use and contribution.
* Two recipes are included in the initial release: [Jira](/fusion-connectors/lihmnw/jira) and [Confluence](/fusion-connectors/8sbhj5/confluence). Additional recipes are being developed and will be released as they are finalized.
* This release also includes two forms of authentication: [OAuth](/fusion-connectors/h66upi/use-oauth) and Basic Auth.

The REST connector supports crawl and recrawl:

* Full crawl retrieves all objects from the datasource.
* Recrawl relies on the `strayContentDeletion` feature from the `connectors-service` to ensure deleted objects from the source are also removed from the index.

Two-level object discovery:

* Allows defining a root request to retrieve first-level objects.
* Supports a list of child requests (children of the main request) to retrieve second-level objects.
* By default, objects retrieved with the root request and child requests are indexed as individual Solr documents.

The REST connector supports two types of pagination:

* Next page URL uses a URL to fetch the next page of results.
* Batch size and index start use a batch size and starting index to paginate through results.

Parsing can be done in one of two ways:

* When parsing within the plugin, the response is parsed as a JSON object structure using JSONPath. This is the default behavior.
* When parsing with Fusion, the response is emitted directly to Fusion, where Fusion parsers handle the binary data. Enable this feature by setting the property `Send as Binary Data`.

By default, parent and child objects are indexed as individual Solr documents. To merge child objects into the parent object instead of indexing them separately, configure the property `Child Response Mapping → Custom Solr Field`. This feature works only when both parent and child objects are parsed as JSON objects.

The following variables are used when configuring a datasource:

* `${LW_BATCH_SIZE}`: Used with pagination by batch size. This variable represents the `size` query parameter defined in the property, `Pagination By BatchSize → BatchSize`.
* `${LW_INDEX_START}`: Used with pagination by batch size. This variable represents the `start-point` query parameter defined in the property `Pagination By BatchSize → IndexStart`, which is used to traverse the pagination.
* `${LW_PARENT_DATA_KEY}`: Used with the child request configuration. This variable is replaced with the `id` extracted from the root object using the property `Parent Data Key`.

<Note>
This connector is compatible with Fusion 5.9.0 and later.

* Fixed a bug that removed access control lists (ACLs) during incremental crawls in Azure Active Directory. This bug resulted from a deviation from the LDAP ACLs V2 connector’s [unique incremental crawl behavior](/fusion-connectors/4selgx/ldap-ac-ls-v-2#incremental-crawls) for Azure Active Directory.
* Fixed a bug that sometimes deleted ACLs that the indexing job failed to update during its previous run.
* Known issue: The job may complete with a "Successful" status even when a network communication error occurred.

### February 9, 2023 - SharePoint Optimized V2 Connector v1.2.0

The [SharePoint Optimized V2 Connector](/fusion-connectors/3qqudu/share-point-optimized-v-2) is upgraded to v1.2.0.

* Fixed a bug that sometimes generated a "User cannot be found" error statement and prevented the connector from indexing files.
* Updated the description of the **Item size limit** property to clarify its behavior.

### January 19, 2023 - Web V2 v1.1.0

The [Web V2 connector](/fusion-connectors/tq6l3z/web-v-2-connector) is upgraded to v1.1.0.

* Fixed a bug that sometimes prevented the connector from parsing PDF, Word, Excel, and other file types.
* Some conflicting dependencies were removed to resolve errors.
* A missing dependency, guava-retrying, was added to resolve a `NoClassDefFoundError` error.
* A bug was fixed that resulted in the connector performing full crawls instead of recrawling as expected.
* Known issue: JavaScript evaluation is not functional at this time.
* Known issue: The counter values in the **Datasources > DATASOURCE_NAME > Job History** view do not reflect actual values, when the datasource uses the Web V2 connector.

### January 6, 2023 - Sharepoint Optimized v1.1.0

The [Sharepoint Optimized V2 connector](/fusion-connectors/3qqudu/share-point-optimized-v-2) is upgraded to v1.1.0. This upgrade includes several bug fixes.

* A bug that sometimes prevented files from being deleted as expected when the datasource was recrawled was fixed.
* A bug that prevented the connector from indexing data within certain lists was fixed.
* When indexing data to the `MetaInfo_s` field, an error could occur that prevented indexing data when the data was too large. Now, data larger than 32,766 bytes is indexed to the `MetaInfo_txt` field instead.
* The connector now accepts URLs with spaces.

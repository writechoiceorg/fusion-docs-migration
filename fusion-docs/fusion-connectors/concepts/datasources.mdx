A datasource is a complete data ingest configuration that consists of the following components:

* **Connector.** Connectors are out-of-the-box components for pulling your data into Fusion. Lucidworks provides a wide variety of connectors, each specialized for a particular data type. For a list of connectors, see [Fusion Connectors](/fusion-connectors/2/fusion-connectors).
* **Parser.** Parsers provide fine-grained configuration for inbound data.

  + For Fusion 5.x, see [Parsers](/fusion/5.9/370/parsers) for more information.
  + For Fusion 4.x, see [Parsers](/fusion-server/4.2/370/parsers) for more information.
* **Index pipeline.** Index pipelines transform incoming data for indexing by Fusion.

  + For Fusion 5.x, see [Index Pipelines](/fusion/5.9/162/index-pipelines) for more information.
  + For Fusion 4.x, see [Index Pipelines](/fusion-server/4.2/162/index-pipelines) for more information.

Fusion includes all available connectors in **Indexing > Datasources**. Some connectors come pre-installed, but you must install others manually. See the following resources for your version of Fusion:

* [Install a Connector - 5.2 and later](/how-to/8810/install-a-connector-5-2-and-later)
* [Install a Connector - Fusion 5.1](/how-to/8811/install-a-connector-fusion-5-1)
* [Install a Connector - Fusion 4.x](/how-to/8813/install-a-connector-fusion-4-x)

Connectors are pre-built components that act as bridges between your data and Fusion. They pull data from various sources and ingest it into Fusion for searching. Lucidworks provides a wide range of connectors, each specializing in a particular data type. There are connectors for databases, filesystems, repositories, social media, and more.

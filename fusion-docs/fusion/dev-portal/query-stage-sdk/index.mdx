In addition to Fusion’s [built-in query stages](/fusion/5.9/278/query-pipeline-stages), Lucidworks provides the Query Stage SDK for developing your own custom query stages with Java. All of the resources are provided in a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/lucidworks/query-stage-sdk).

## Getting started

Clone the repository to get started:

```
git clone https://github.com/lucidworks/query-stage-sdk
```

See [Gradle quickstart](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/tutorial_java_projects.html) documentation for more information on Java Projects.

<Note>
The Query Stage SDK requires the [Fusion Search DSL](/fusion/5.9/8833/domain-specific-language-dsl).

## Query Stage SDK library

The Java SDK library contains the classes and interfaces for building new query plugin stages. You’ll find it in the [`query-stage-plugin-sdk` directory](https://github.com/lucidworks/query-stage-sdk/tree/master/query-stage-plugin-sdk).

## Example plugin stage

The example query stage plugin contains an example of how a plugin can be implemented as well as information on how to build and deploy the plugin. You’ll find it in the [`examples/sample-plugin-stage` directory](https://github.com/lucidworks/query-stage-sdk/tree/master/examples/sample-plugin-stage).

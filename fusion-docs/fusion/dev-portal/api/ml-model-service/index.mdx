Use these APIs to deploy machine learning (ML) models and generate predictions.
Fusionâ€™s Machine Learning (ML) Model service stores deployed models and runs prediction jobs.

* [ML Model API](/managed-fusion/5.9/u0ihks/ml-model-api)

  Use this API to deploy ML models and generate predictions.
* [Serialized Model API](/fusion/5.9/83ujtc/serialized-model-api)

  The Serialized Model API is for fetching, updating, or deleting deployed models.

For more information, [view the API specification.](?open-api=true)

Fusion also provides convenient jobs you can configure to deploy your models via the ML Model service, plus pipelines and pipeline stages for querying them.
See these topics:

* [Develop and Deploy a Machine Learning Model](/how-to/5yl6sw/develop-and-deploy-a-machine-learning-model) provides general instructions for using ML models with Fusion, including pre-trained models and your own custom models.
  Lucidworks provides pre-trained models for [sentiment analysis and prediction](/fusion/5.9/453/sentiment-analysis-and-prediction) and [Smart Answers](/fusion/5.9/461/smart-answers).
  Then you can query your model using the [Machine Learning query pipeline stage](/fusion/5.9513/machine-learning-stage).
* [Train a Smart Answers Supervised Model](/how-to/ti9rcr/train-a-smart-answers-supervised-model) explains how to configure the [Smart Answers Supervised Training](/fusion/5.9/8845/smart-answers-supervised-training) job to train a model on an existing body of question/answer data and deploy it for use with your [Smart Answers pipelines](/how-to/918/configure-the-smart-answers-pipelines-5-3-and-later).
* If your existing question/answer data is sparse or your data is in another format, use the [Train a Smart Answers Cold Start Model](/how-to/hxiuyl/train-a-smart-answers-cold-start-model) to train and deploy a model you can use to get started.
  Lucidworks also provides [pre-trained cold start models](/how-to/734/set-up-a-pre-trained-cold-start-model-for-smart-answers) you can use.

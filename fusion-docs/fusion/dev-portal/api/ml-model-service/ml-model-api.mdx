The Machine Learning (ML) Model service is a model prediction API for MLeap/Spark-ML models, as well as pass-through to Seldon Core-based models.
Use this API to list the deployed ML models in Fusion and generate predictions.

For more information, [view the API specification.](?open-api=true)

## Examples

Get the list of deployed models

```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD https://FUSION_HOST/api/ai/ml-models
```

Response:

```json
{
    "models": [
        {
            "model_id": "lucidworks-sentiment",
            "type": "mleap",
            "last_modified": "2024-09-13T19:43:20Z"
        },
        {
            "model_id": "opennlp",
            "type": "open-nlp",
            "last_modified": "2024-09-13T19:43:15Z"
        },
        {
            "model_id": "sentiment-reviews",
            "type": "seldon",
            "last_modified": "2024-09-13T20:29:05Z"
        }
    ]
}
```

Check that a deployed model is working

```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD -X POST https://FUSION_HOST/api/ai/ml-models/sentiment-reviews/prediction \
-d '{"text": "Hello world.  How are you doing today?"}'
```

Response:

```json
{
    "score": [
        "0.8543054461479187"
    ],
    "label": [
        "positive"
    ],
    "_rawJsonResponse": "{\n  \"names\": [\"label\", \"score\", \"tokens\", \"attention_weights\"],\n  \"ndarray\": [[\"positive\"], [\"0.8543054461479187\"]]\n}"
}
```

A `500` server error indicates that either the model is not properly deployed, the model ID is wrong, or the input fields are wrong.

View API specification

Use these endpoints to deploy and manage models via Seldon Core.
To fetch predictions, see the [ML Model API](/fusion/5.9/st3vbc/ml-model-api).

For more information, [view the API specification.](?open-api=true)

## Examples



```bash Deploy a model
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD -L -X POST 'https://FUSION_HOST/api/ai/ml-models?modelId=opennlp&type=seldon' \
-d '@/Users/me/opennlp.bin'
```

```bash Check that the opennlp model exists
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD https://FUSION_HOST/api/ai/ml-models/opennlp
```

The response is `200 OK` if the model is deployed or `404 Not Found` if it is not.

```bash Download the opennlp model from Fusion
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD https://FUSION_HOST/api/ai/ml-models/opennlp
```

The response is a binary file.

```bash Delete the opennlp model from Fusion
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD -X DELETE https://FUSION_HOST/api/ai/ml-models/opennlp
```

The response is `204 No Content` when the deletion succeeds.

The Custom Rules API allows you to create, read, update, and delete [custom rules](/fusion/5.9/8835/business-rules#custom-rule-actions).

For more information, [view the API specification.](?open-api=true)

## Example

The following example will create a new custom rule type in the myFusionApp app. The new custom rule type will use a pipeline with an ID of **custom-rule-pipeline** and will have two custom text fields for **Manufacturer** and **Type**.

This assumes a pipeline called custom-rule-pipeline already exists. If that is not the case, you can add `/{id}` to the URL and use `PUT` instead of `POST` to update an existing custom rule type. See [Create Custom Rule Actions with the API](/how-to/699/create-custom-rules-api.asciidoc) for more information on creating custom rule types.

```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD -XPOST -H "Content-type:application/json" \
https://FUSION_HOST:6764/api/apps/{app-name}/custom-rule-types -d '{
  "id":"{custom-rule-type}",
  "pipeline_id":"{query-pipeline}",
  "display_type":"My Custom Rule",
  "schema": {
    "type" : "object",
    "properties" : {
      "custom_param1" : {
        "type" : "string",
        "title" : "Manufacturer",
        "description" : "The manufacturer of the product this rule action applies to."
      },
      "custom_param2" : {
        "type": "string",
        "title": "Type",
        "description": "The type of product this rule action applies to."
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

The [Query Profiles API](?open-api=true#/operations/getStatus), formerly known as the Query API, is used to send queries to a [query profile](/fusion/5.9/174/query-profiles).

You can run a query through a query profile by specifying the profile ID and appending the request with a [Solr query string](/fusion/5.9/199/solr-query-language-cheat-sheet), as in `/api/query/<id>?<solrQuery>`.

For query profile CRUD operations, see the [Query Profiles CRUD API](/fusion/5.9/363/query-profiles-crud-api).

You can use the Query Profiles CRUD API to [find the profile ID](?open-api=true#/operations/getAllEntities) that you want to use with the Query Profiles API:

```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD https://FUSION_HOST:FUSION_PORT/api/query-profiles
```

### Examples to retrieve query results

To [retrieve query results](?open-api=true#/operations/query), a simple query is sent to a profile ID using a question mark (?) as the query string separator, followed by the query term as indicated to Solr as `q`.

REQUEST

This request sends `comedy` as a query to a profile that is set up with a movies collection.

```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD https://FUSION_HOST:FUSION_PORT/api/query/PROFILE_ID?q=comedy

```

{  "response": {"docs": [
      { "...
        "_lw_data_source_collection_s": " PROFILE_ID",
        ...
        "title_t": "Original Kings of Comedy, The (2000)",
        "_lw_pipeline_ss": ["PIPELINE_ID"],
        "genres_t": "Comedy|Documentary",
        ...
      },
      { "...
        "_lw_data_source_collection_s": " PROFILE_ID ",
        ...
        "title_t": "Blue Collar Comedy Tour: The Movie (2003)",
        "_lw_pipeline_ss": ["PIPELINE_ID"],
        "genres_t": "Comedy|Documentary",
      },
     ...
}
```

You can use multiple words in a query:

REQUEST

```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD https://FUSION_HOST:FUSION_PORT/api/query/PROFILE_ID?q=kings%20of
```

RESPONSE

```json
{  "response": {"docs": [
      {...
        "title_t": "Original Kings of Comedy, The (2000)",
        ...
      },
      {...
        "title_t": "Kings of Summer, The (2013)",
       ...
      },]
}
```

For a specific match, use double quotes (`”`) around the query:

```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD https://FUSION_HOST:FUSION_PORT/api/query/PROFILE_ID?q="Kings%20of%20Comedy"
```

The Indexing APIs are a group of APIs that can help you manage the way your Fusion instance ingests and processes documents and signals.
You can use them to manage your [index pipelines](/fusion/5.9/351/index-pipelines-api), [index profiles](/fusion/5.9/348/index-profiles-api), and [index stages](/fusion/5.9/349/index-stages-api).

For more information, [view the API specification.](?open-api=true)

<Note>
This group also contains APIs for [parsers](/fusion/5.9/308/parsers-api), but these endpoints are [deprecated in Fusion 5.9.11](/fusion/5.9/z72wlm/fusion-5-9-11#deprecations) and will be removed at a later date.
Use the [Async Parsing API](/fusion/5.9/mwbgkx/async-parsing-api) instead.
</Note>

Fusion indexes data into collections in Solr.
Indexing optimizes the data for search, after which it can be [queried](/fusion/5.9/3215/query-data-flow).
[Index stages](/fusion/5.9/8799/index-pipeline-stages) process data according to their function.
To see all available index pipeline stages, refer to [Index pipeline stages reference](/fusion/5.9/229/index-pipeline-stages-reference).
[Index pipelines](/fusion/5.9/162/index-pipelines) are groupings of one or more index stages, and the order of stages affects how the data is indexed.
[Index profiles](/fusion/5.9/160/index-profiles) are mappings of index pipelines, parsers, and collections. Theyâ€™re useful for sharing index pipelines across multiple collections.

Use these endpoints to perform the following indexing operations:

* Create, modify, and delete index profiles.
* Send documents directly to an index profile for indexing.
* View the available index pipeline stages and their configuration parameters.
* View, install, and manage custom index stages developed with the Index Stage SDK.

<Tip>
**LeadingPractice**

Lucidworks recommends using the [Index Profiles API](/fusion/5.9/348/index-profiles-api) to push one or more JSON records to an index pipeline.
Include a transaction code on each record.
In the index pipeline, add fields to support troubleshooting such as Solr indexed timestamp, batch ID or hash of content record.
This lets you query Fusion to compare against expected values to determine if there are missing documents.

<Note>
These endpoints are [deprecated in Fusion 5.9.11](/fusion/5.9/z72wlm/fusion-5-9-11#deprecations) and will be removed at a later date.
Use the [Async Parsing API](/fusion/5.9/mwbgkx/async-parsing-api) instead.
</Note>

The Parser API provides CRUD operations for [parsers](/fusion/5.9/370/parsers).

To configure an index pipeline to use a specific parser, see the [Index Pipelines API](/fusion/5.9/351/index-pipelines-api).

For more information, [view the API specification.](?open-api=true)

<Note>
In order to see this object within the [Fusion UI](/fusion/5.9/121/object-explorer), it **must** be associated with an app. To do this, create the object using the `/apps` endpoint.

The Index Stages API provides endpoints to list index stage configuration properties.

For more information, [view the API specification.](?open-api=true)

An index pipeline is comprised of index stages.
Each index stage has a name and a type.
The name identifies the stage instance, and the type identifies its class.
Every stage type has a number of properties, which can be configured for a particular index stage instance.
See the section [Index Pipeline Stages](/fusion/5.9/8799/index-pipeline-stages) for a taxonomy of index stage types.

The Connector APIs are a group of APIs that you can use to configure connectors. You can use them to [configure datasources and the crawl database](/fusion/5.9/353/connector-datasources-api), [install connectors and update existing ones](/fusion/5.9/356/connector-plugins-api), and [create logs of installed connector configurations](/fusion/5.9/354/connector-plugins-repository-api).

For more information, [view the API specification.](?open-api=true)

Connectors pull data into Fusion. They work together with parsers and index pipelines to comprise [datasources](/fusion-connectors/31/datasources). You can use connectors to pull data from a variety of data repositories, applications, and websites. Use the [find your connector](/fusion-connectors/3/find-your-connector) tool to view all connectors supported in your version of Fusion.

Connectors are system objects, which means installing, updating, and deleting connectors affects all apps in your Fusion deployment.

<Note>
Some endpoints only work with V2 connectors. To learn more about the different connector frameworks, refer to [V1 and V2 connectors](/fusion-connectors/331vyj/v-1-and-v-2-connectors).

## Connector security

For high-security applications, you can configure connectors to run [remotely behind firewalls](/fusion-connectors/8xhsoc/remote-v-2-connectors), instead of hosting them in Fusion. Also, some connectors support security trimming, which restricts query results based on user ID. In Fusion 5.9.0 and later, connectors use [graph security trimming](/fusion/5.9/zdzlfu/graph-security-trimming-stage). In Fusion 5.8.1 and earlier, they use the [security trimming stage](/fusion/5.9/272/security-trimming-stage).

## Connector compatibility

Connectors are developed and released separately from Fusion, although their functionality and compatibility is closely tied to Fusion versions. Refer to the [connector release notes](/fusion-connectors/4/release-notes) for more information.

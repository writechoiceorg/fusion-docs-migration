Fusion’s Job REST Server stores your job configurations and communicates with other services to compute recommendations, index signals, and control jobs.
You can use it to generate customized lists of recommended items based on a set of signals, index your signals directly into a signals collection, or configure and monitor your Spark jobs.

Job REST Server APIs include the following:

* [Recommendations API](/fusion/5.9/8826/recommendations-api)

  Fetch recommended documents based on raw or aggregated signals.
  Fusion can generate recommendations based on what users have searched for, clicked, saved, purchased, or any other type of user-generated event signal.
  You can get recommendations based on signals from one user or from many.
  For complete details, see [Recommendations](/fusion/5.9/3241/recommendations).
* [Signals API](/fusion/5.9/549/signals-api)

  Generally, you use this API to index signals directly into a signals collection.
  Alternatively, you can index signals through the [Indexing APIs](/fusion/5.9/gq9miz/indexing-ap-is).
  For additional details, see [Indexing Signals](/fusion/5.9/3225/indexing-signals).
  To aggregate your signals, see the Spark Jobs API (below).
* [Spark Jobs API](/fusion/5.9/312/spark-jobs-api)

  Create, control, and run Spark jobs in Fusion, including SQL aggregation jobs, Python jobs, and Scala script jobs.
  You can also fetch job logs from Fusion’s Spark pods for monitoring and troubleshooting.
  See [Spark Jobs](/fusion/5.9/187/spark-jobs) for additional details about different types of Spark jobs and how to configure them.

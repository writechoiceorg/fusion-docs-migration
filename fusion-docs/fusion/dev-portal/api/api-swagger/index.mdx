This group of APIs can help you with the general management of your Fusion instance. Use APIs to manage [App Studio](/fusion/5.9/325/apps-api) objects. Use the [Configurations](/fusion/5.9/342/configurations-api) APIs to establish relationships between Fusion objects, connect your Fusion instance to [Solr clusters](/fusion/5.9/313/solr-api), and manage license files. Or, create a [history](/fusion/5.9/343/history-api) of service events, define schedules for [jobs](/fusion/5.9/327/jobs-api), and more.

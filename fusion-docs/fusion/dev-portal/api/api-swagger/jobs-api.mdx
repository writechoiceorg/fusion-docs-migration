The Jobs API allows you to define schedules for objects that perform work. You can schedule datasources, tasks, and Spark jobs.

This topic explains how to format requests to the Jobs API. To learn how to work with jobs and schedules in the Fusion UI, see [Jobs and Schedules](/fusion/5.9/184/jobs-and-scheduling).

For more information, [view the API specification.](?open-api=true)

## Job runtime configuration

<Note>
In order to see this object within the [Fusion UI](/fusion/5.9/121/object-explorer), it **must** be associated with an app. To do this, create the object using the `/apps` endpoint.
</Note>

Job configuration requests have these parameters:

* `<type>:<id>` path parameter (required)

  The resource identifier takes the form `<type>:<id>`, such as `datasource:movie-db`, `spark:dailyMetricsRollup-counters`, or `task:delete-old-system-logs`.

  See [Job types](#types) below.
* `enabled` body parameter

  "True" or "false" to enable or disable the job.
* `triggers` body parameter

  This parameter defines one or more conditions that trigger the job. See [Job triggers](#triggers) below.

Below is an example request that configures a job:

```sh
PUT /jobs/datasource:movie-db/schedule
{
  "enabled": true,
  "triggers": [
    {"type": "cron", "enabled": true, "value": "0 */10 * * * *"}
  ]
}
```

### Job types

The job type must be specified as part of the resource identifier in `PUT`, `POST`, and `DELETE` calls. These are the possible job types:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| `datasource` | A job to ingest data according to the specified datasource configuration, such as `datasource:movie-db`. Datasources are created using the [Connector Datasources API](/fusion/5.9/353/connector-datasources-api) or the Fusion UI.  See [Datasource Jobs](/fusion/5.9/186/datasource-jobs). |
| `spark` | A Spark job to process data, such as `spark:dailyMetricsRollup-counters`. Spark jobs are created using the [Spark Jobs API](/fusion/5.9/312/spark-jobs-api) or the Fusion UI.  See [Spark Jobs](/fusion/5.9/187/spark-jobs). |
| `task` | A job to perform an HTTP call or log cleanup, such as `task:delete-old-system-logs`. Tasks are created using the Fusion UI.  See [Tasks](/fusion/5.9/183/tasks). |

### Job triggers

Each job can have multiple triggers, and each trigger configuration requires `enabled` and `type` parameters.

Additional parameters are required by each trigger type, described below:

| Trigger type | Parameters |
| --- | --- |
| `interval`  Run the job at a regular interval over some time range. | * `startTime`  The date and time at which the job will first run, as an [ISO-8601 date-time string](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime). * `endTime`  The date and time at which the job will run last, as an ISO-8601 date-time string. * `interval`  The interval at which the job will run, as an integer whose unit is specified by `repeatUnit` below. * `repeatUnit`  One of: `minute`, `hour`, or `day`. |
| `cron`  Run the job on a cron-style schedule. | `value`  A cron string. |
| `job`  Run the job after another job succeeds or fails. | * `jobID`  The ID of the job that triggers this one. * `runOnSuccess`  "True" to run when the specified job succeeds. * `runOnFailure`  "True" to run when the specified job fails. * `runOnAbort`  "True" to run when the specified job is aborted. |

## Examples

### Get all datasource jobs

**Input**

```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD https://FUSION_HOST:FUSION_PORT/api/jobs?type=datasource
```

**Output**

```json
[ {
  "resource" : "datasource:ratings-db",
  "enabled" : true,
  "startedBy" : "acb38917-611a-46e1-a3cf-4ed46a30fd24"
}, {
  "resource" : "datasource:movies-db",
  "enabled" : true,
  "startedBy" : "acb38917-611a-46e1-a3cf-4ed46a30fd24",
  "status" : "success", //Values include "ready", "running", "success", "aborted", or "failed".
  "lastStartTime" : "2017-05-17T20:58:10.503Z",
  "lastEndTime" : "2017-05-17T20:58:42.020Z"
} ]

```

### Start a datasource job now

**Input**

```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://FUSION_HOST:FUSION_PORT/api/jobs/datasource:movies-db/actions -d '{"action": "start"}'
```

**Output**

```json
{
  "resource" : "datasource:movies-db",
  "action" : "start",
  "accepted" : true,
  "message" : "Started job datasource:movies-db"
}
```

### Get the job history for a datasource

**Input**

```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD https://FUSION_HOST:FUSION_PORT/api/jobs/datasource:movies-db/history
```

**Output**

```json
[ {
  "resource" : "datasource:movies-db",
  "startTime" : "2017-05-17T21:01:46.743Z",
  "endTime" : "2017-05-17T21:02:05.720Z",
  "status" : "success" //Values include "ready", "running", "success", "aborted", or "failed".
}, {
  "resource" : "datasource:movies-db",
  "startTime" : "2017-05-17T20:58:10.503Z",
  "endTime" : "2017-05-17T20:58:42.020Z",
  "status" : "success" //Values include "ready", "running", "success", "aborted", or "failed".
} ]
```

### Define a trigger for a datasource job

**Input**

```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://FUSION_HOST:FUSION_PORT/api/jobs/datasource:ratings-db/schedule -d '{"triggers": [{"type": "cron", "enabled": "true", "expression": "0 15 10 ? * MON-FRI"}]}'
```

**Output**

```json
{
  "resource" : "datasource:ratings-db",
  "triggers" : [ {
    "type" : "cron",
    "enabled" : true,
    "expression" : "0 15 10 ? * MON-FRI",
    "type" : "cron"
  } ]
}
```

The Links API manages the links that represent the relationships between Fusion objects. You can see these links in the [Object Explorer](/fusion/5.9/121/object-explorer) by pressing CMD-K or CTRL-K from any screen in the Fusion UI. You can also export and import links using the [Objects API](/fusion/5.9/326/objects-api).

Links are structured as a tuple of `(subject, object, linkType)`. An example would be `(foo, bar, dependsOn)`, which would read as "foo dependsOn bar".

## Link types and link reversibility

The possible values of `linkType` are as follows:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| `inContextOf` | The subject exists in the context of the object, which is an app.  In this example, the "Movie_Search" app is the context for a parser with the same name:  ``` {   "subject" : "parser:Movie_Search",   "object" : "app:Movie_Search",   "linkType" : "inContextOf",   "originator" : "unspecified" } ``` |
| `hasContext` | The subject is an app that contains the object.  In this example, an index profile exists in the context of the "Movie_Search" app:  ``` {   "subject" : "app:Movie_Search",   "object" : "index-profile:Movie_Search",   "linkType" : "hasContext",   "originator" : "unspecified" } ``` |
| `dependsOn` | The subject depends on the object.  In this example, a datasource called "web_pokeapi_co-default" depends on a parser by the same name:  ``` {   "subject" : "datasource:web_pokeapi_co-default",   "object" : "parser:web_pokeapi_co-default",   "linkType" : "dependsOn" } ``` |
| `supports` | The subject is depended on by the object (the reverse of `dependsOn`).  In this example, a parser called "web_pokeapi_co-default" supports a datasource by the same name:  ``` {   "subject" : "parser:web_pokeapi_co-default",   "object" : "datasource:web_pokeapi_co-default",   "linkType" : "supports" } ``` |
| `isPartOf` | The subject is part of the object, where the object is a group.  In this example, an aggregation called "click-signals-default" is part of a group called "signals-object-group-default":  ``` {   "subject" : "aggregation:click-signals-default",   "object" : "group:signals-object-group-default",   "linkType" : "isPartOf" } ``` |
| `hasPart` | The subject is a group, of which the object is a member (the reverse of `isPartOf`).  In this example, an aggregation called "click-signals-default" is part of a group called "signals-object-group-default":  ``` {   "subject" : "group:signals-object-group-default",   "object" : "aggregation:click-signals-default",   "linkType" : "hasPart" } ``` |
| `relatesTo` | The subject relates to the object. This is a uni-directional relationship that associates two objects that have none of the relationships described above.  For example, when recommendations are enabled for the default collection, Fusion creates a group of objects which relates to the default collection:  ``` {   "subject" : "group:recommendations-default",   "object" : "collection:default",   "linkType" : "relatesTo" } ``` |

With the exception of the `relatesTo` link type, links are reversible:

* `inContextOf` is the reverse of `hasContext` (and vice versa).
* `dependsOn` is the reverse of `supports` (and vice versa).
* `isPartOf` is the reverse of `hasPart` (and vice versa).

For example, here is the group of links for the `signals-default` collection:

```json
[
  {
    "subject": "group:4e6ee9a6-d4ab-413a-ac70-a27c1445bb60",
    "object": "collection:default_signals_aggr",
    "linkType": "hasPart"
  },
  {
    "subject": "group:4e6ee9a6-d4ab-413a-ac70-a27c1445bb60",
    "object": "spark:default_click_signals_aggregation",
    "linkType": "hasPart"
  },
  {
    "subject": "group:4e6ee9a6-d4ab-413a-ac70-a27c1445bb60",
    "object": "collection:default",
    "linkType": "relatesTo"
  },
  {
    "subject": "group:4e6ee9a6-d4ab-413a-ac70-a27c1445bb60",
    "object": "collection:default_signals",
    "linkType": "hasPart"
  }
]
```

When we request the links for one of the `hasPart` objects shown above, we get the reverse representation:

```http
GET https://FUSION_HOST:FUSION_PORT/api/links?subject=collection:default_signals_aggr

[
  {
    "subject": "collection:default_signals_aggr",
    "object": "group:4e6ee9a6-d4ab-413a-ac70-a27c1445bb60",
    "linkType": "isPartOf"
  }
]
```

## Examples

**Get links to the default collection**

```bash
curl https://FUSION_HOST:FUSION_PORT/api/links?subject=collection:default
```

Output:

```json
[ { "subject": "collection:default", "object": "index-pipeline:default", "linkType": "supports" } ]
```

**Create a new link**

```bash
curl -X PUT https://FUSION_HOST:FUSION_PORT/api/links -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"linkType": "supports", "object": "index-pipeline:default", "subject": "collection:default"}'
```

Output:

```json
{ "subject" : "collection:default", "object" : "index-pipeline:default", "linkType" : "supports" }
```

**Delete a link**

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://FUSION_HOST:FUSION_PORT/api/links?subject=collection:default
```

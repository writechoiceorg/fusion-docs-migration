This section of the documentation contains technical reference guides for software developers who want to configure and customize Fusion.
Refer to this reference documentation to help manage your Fusion deployment, develop front-end search applications, configure custom connectors, and create custom pipeline stages.
To develop and integrate with Fusion, you should have a working knowledge of Java, Solr, and RESTful architecture.
When developing front-end applications, familiarity with Javascript is also helpful.

## Fusion REST APIs

Use [Fusionâ€™s REST APIs](/fusion/5.9/424/fusion-rest-ap-is) to create custom integrations and applications.
Automate administrative tasks, manage your Fusion instance, deploy and run machine learning models, and more.

## Front-end development

Learn about [front-end development](/fusion/5.9/177/front-end-development) with Fusion and how to configure common search application features, like [autocomplete](/fusion/5.9/178/autocomplete).
This section also contains [examples](/fusion/5.9/3217/rest-api-examples-for-front-end-development) of typical API and query calls when configuring front-end applications.

## Connectors

The [Connectors SDK](/fusion/5.9/15/connectors-sdk) lets you create custom connectors to ingest data from external sources. Fusion connectors are built using a Java-based framework.

## Index and Query Stage SDKs

You can develop your own custom, Java-based pipeline stages using the [Index Stage SDK](/fusion/5.9/159/index-stage-sdk) and the [Query Stage SDK](/fusion/5.9/hbu2ug/query-stage-sdk).

## Javadocs

[Javadocs](/fusion/5.9/8822/pipeline-javadocs) provide descriptions of the classes and methods used in Fusion that you can use when developing front-end search applications.

## App Studio

[App Studio](/fusion/5.9/963/fusion-app-studio) is a collection of software and resources for building modern, user-friendly apps to search and visualize your Fusion data.

[ConfigSync](/fusion/5.9/j47yes/config-sync) can operate in different modes:

* [Publisher mode](/fusion/5.9/b1rtue/publisher-mode): Monitors Fusion for changes and pushes them to a Git repository.
* [Subscriber mode](/fusion/5.9/t51vvb/subscriber-mode): Polls a Git repository for changes and applies them to Fusion.
* [Pub/Sub mode](/fusion/5.9/r0xnd3/pub-sub-mode): Combines the features of both Publisher and Subscriber modes.

See [Configure the ConfigSync mode](/how-to/config-sync/r4vnii/configure-the-config-sync-mode) for steps to configure the synchronization mode.

Similar to [query stage plugins](/fusion/5.9/l1mi38/query-stage-plugins), these are binary blobs that enhance or modify the indexing process in Fusion.
They’re specifically targeted by ConfigSync for seamless integration.

For a deeper understanding, see the [Index Stage SDK](/fusion/5.9/159/index-stage-sdk).

These plugins are kept in `_lw_system/index-stage-plugins`, ensuring they’re correctly managed and deployed by ConfigSync.

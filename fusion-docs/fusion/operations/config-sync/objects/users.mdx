User data files are stored within the directory `_lw_system/users`.
This designated location consolidates all user-related information, facilitating efficient data management and access.

## File naming convention

The naming convention for user files is structured as `<USERNAME>---<REALM>`.
This format is carefully chosen to ensure uniqueness and organization within the system.
It allows for easy identification and retrieval of user-specific data by linking the username directly to their associated security realm.

## Components

* **Username**: This is a unique identifier for each user.
  It is a string that distinguishes one user from another within the system.
* **Realm**: The realm refers to the security domain within which the user operates.
  It is a critical component of the systemâ€™s security model, segregating users based on their access permissions and operational scope.

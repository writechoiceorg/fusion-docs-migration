ConfigSync enhances Fusion’s capabilities by allowing for the efficient management of both custom and standard connector plugins.
This functionality is pivotal for extending the data integration and processing capabilities of Fusion.

## Custom connectors

Custom connectors are identified based on their presence and version compatibility with the connector repository.
A connector is deemed custom if it:

* Is not listed in the [Connector plugins repository](/fusion-connectors/3/find-your-connector).
* Has a version that differs from what is available in the repository.
  Furthermore, only connectors following the version 2 (v2) architecture, also known as non-classic connectors, are recognized as custom.

### Connector repository

Connectors such as "kaltura (v2)" and "solr (classic)" are available in the repository with specific versions and SDK compatibility.
You can see this information at the `/api/connectors/repository` endpoint.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "lucidworks.kaltura",
    "displayName": "kaltura (v2)",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "sdkVersion": "4.1.3",
    "location": "4.1.3/lucidworks.connector.kaltura/1.0.0/lucidworks.connector.kaltura-1.0.0.zip"
  },
  {
    "id": "lucid.solr",
    "displayName": "solr (classic)",
    "version": "5.5.1",
    "sdkVersion": "5.5.1",
    "location": "/classic/apps/connectors/repository-plugins/lucidworks.solr-5.5.1.zip"
  }
]
```

### Deployed connectors

Examples include `lucidworks.workday`, `lucidworks.kaltura`, and `lucid.solr` marked as `DEPLOYED` in Fusion’s connectors list.
You can see this information at the `/api/connectors/plugins` endpoint.

```json
[
  {
    "type": "lucidworks.workday",
    "state": "DEPLOYED"
  },
  {
    "type": "lucidworks.kaltura",
    "state": "DEPLOYED"
  },
  {
    "type": "lucid.solr",
    "state": "DEPLOYED"
  }
]
```

### Custom connector criteria

* `lucidworks.kaltura` is custom due to its unique developmental version `0.1.0-dev.565.uncommitted+kaltura.5.4.nwm.1217913` not matching the repository’s version `0.0.1`.
* `lucidworks.workday` qualifies as custom because it is absent in the repository.
* `lucid.solr` is not considered custom as it is a classic connector.

```json
{
  "id": "EC0oe4dWRX",
  "name": "lucidworks.kaltura",
  "pluginVersion": "0.1.0-dev.565.uncommitted+kaltura.5.4.nwm.1217913",
  "sdkVersion": "4.0.0",
  "schema": {}
}
```

### Storage of custom connectors

Custom connectors are systematically stored in the `_lw_system/connectors-plugins` folder within the config-sync repository.

## Standard connectors

ConfigSync facilitates the automatic installation of non-custom connectors.
When creating or migrating a data source associated with a non-custom connector that is not yet installed, ConfigSync employs Fusion’s default mechanism to install the latest version from the repository.
This ensures seamless data source integration.

If a commit introduces a data source linked to an uninstalled non-custom connector, ConfigSync automatically proceeds with its installation.

These are binary blobs used by Fusion to extend or customize the behavior of query processing stages.
ConfigSync specifically manages these plugins to ensure they’re correctly integrated into Fusion.

Check out the [Query Stage SDK](/fusion/5.9/hbu2ug/query-stage-sdk) for details on how these plugins work.

You’ll store these plugins in `_lw_system/query-stage-plugins` within your repo.
This special folder is where ConfigSync looks to manage and synchronize query stage plugins.

See also [Index stage plugins](/fusion/5.9/dnjquf/index-stage-plugins).

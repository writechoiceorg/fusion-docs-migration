When you add a blob to the [blob store](/fusion/5.9/153/blob-storage) in Fusion, extra information is needed:

* **Resource type**: This tells Fusion what kind of file or data you’re adding.
* **Content type**: This is about the file format, such as JPEG, JavaScript, and so on.

  You can find more about these types in the [Blob Store API](/fusion/5.9/305/blob-store-api#blob-types).

## How ConfigSync handles blob metadata

ConfigSync handles this extra information with a special `.metadata` file.
This file has the same name as your blob but is stored in a different location.

For example, if your blob’s path is `app/blobs/some-folder/blob.txt`, then your metadata file’s path should be `APP/.metadata/blobs/FOLDER_NAME/blob.txt`.

## Metadata file structure

This `.metadata` file is a JSON file that looks like this:

```json
{
  "contentType": "text/javascript",
  "resourceType": "file:js-index"
}
```

### Rules for using meta-files

* You only need to include the metadata file when adding new blobs.
  Existing blobs should already have metadata files.
* If you ever need to change the `resourceType` or `contentType` of a blob, update and commit the meta-file.
  No need to re-upload the blob unless it has also changed.

### Metadata for system blobs

The `_lw_system` folder stores custom connectors or JDBC drivers which do not require separate metadata files.

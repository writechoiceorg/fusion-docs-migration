JDBC drivers allow Fusion to connect to various databases, enabling data ingestion from a wide range of sources.
These drivers are also managed by ConfigSync, ensuring that Fusion has the necessary drivers to connect to your databases.

For instructions on uploading JDBC drivers to Fusion, see [Uploading a JDBC Driver to Fusion Server](/how-to/916/upload-a-jdbc-driver-to-fusion-server).

Store your JDBC drivers in `_lw_system/jdbc-drivers`.
ConfigSync handles the rest, making sure theyâ€™re available for Fusion to use.

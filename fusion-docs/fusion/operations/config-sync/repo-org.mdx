This topic explains what youâ€™ll find in the GitHub repository used by ConfigSync.
See also [Set up a GitHub repo for ConfigSync](/how-to/config-sync/y7nigg/set-up-a-git-hub-repo-for-config-sync).

## Branch and Path

If you need to share the same GitHub repo for different clusters or environments,
you can use the `cfg.github.branch` setting to specify the branch in the GitHub repo where the config files are stored.

Additionally (or alternatively) ConfigSync supports a `cfg.github.path` (referred to as `root` in the future)
setting to specify the path in the GitHub repo where the config files are stored.
By default, ConfigSync stores the config files in the root of the GitHub repo.

## Apps and Object Types

Under the `root` directory, there is a directory for each app, such as `app1`, `app2`.
Under each app directory, there are directories for each object type, such as `query-pipelines`, `blobs`, etc.

## System Objects

ConfigSync uses `_lw_system` as the app name for system objects.
This directory is always present in the repo and contains system objects like users, roles, solr configs, etc.

## Reserved Files

Additionally, ConfigSync has set of reserved files in the `root` directory:

* `.lock` - A lock file to prevent concurrent updates
* `.gitattributes` - Used to list LFS files
* `.gitignore` - Used to ignore files that should not be stored in the repo

<Tip>
**Important**


These files should not be modified or deleted.

|-- .gitattributes
|-- .gitignore

```

<Note>
ConfigSync uses the Fusion links API to determine app association for
Fusion objects. However, it does not track links in GitHub as it uses
the directory structure to maintain app association for an object.

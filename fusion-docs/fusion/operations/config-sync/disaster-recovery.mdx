ConfigSync restore operation allows you to restore the Fusion config to a specific state.
To learn more about the ConfigSync repository and branches, see [Repo organization](/fusion/5.9/a6m3du/repo-organization).

## Before you begin

Please make sure that ConfigSync pod is up and running. You can check it by running the following command:

```sh
kubectl get pods | grep config-sync
```

## Restore from the specific branch

To restore from the specific branch, use the `branch=<BRANCH_NAME>` request parameter.

### HTTP request

```http
PUT https://<FUSION-URL>/config-sync/restore?branch=<BRANCH_NAME>
Authorization: Basic <BASE64-ENCODED-AUTH>
```

### cURL request

```bash
curl -I -X PUT -u 'admin:<PASSWORD>' \
  'https://<FUSION-URL>/config-sync/restore?branch=<BRANCH_NAME>'
```

## Restore from a specific commit

First, get the commit SHA from the commit history.
To find the commit you want to restore from:

* Go to the Config Sync GitHub repository.
* Select the branch you want to restore from.
* Click on the `commits` link.
* Find the commit you want to restore from and click on the commit message to view the commit details.
* Copy the commit SHA from the commit details page or from the URL. Also, you could copy it from the commit history page.

To restore from a specific commit, use the `commit=<COMMIT_SHA>` request parameter. For example:

### HTTP request

```http
PUT https://<FUSION-URL>/config-sync/restore?commit=<COMMIT_SHA>
Authorization: Basic <BASE64-ENCODED-AUTH>
```

### cURL request

```bash
curl -I -X PUT -u 'admin:<PASSWORD>' \
  'https://<FUSION-URL>/config-sync/restore?commit=<COMMIT_SHA>'
```

## Restore from a specific date

To restore from a specific date, use the `date=<DATE>` request parameter. The date should be in the `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` UTC format.
For example: `2021-01-01T00:00:00Z`.
In this case ConfigSync restores the config to the state it was at the specified date.
Actually, it restores the config to the state it was at the last commit before the specified date.

### HTTP request

```http
PUT https://<FUSION-URL>/config-sync/restore?date=<DATE>
Authorization: Basic <BASE64-ENCODED-AUTH>
```

### cURL request

```bash
curl -I -X -u 'admin:<PASSWORD>' \
  'https://<FUSION-URL>/config-sync/restore?date=<DATE>'
```

## Restore specific apps

To restore specific apps, use the `apps=<APP1,APP2,…​>` request parameter. For example:

```bash
curl -I -X PUT -u 'admin:<PASSWORD>' \
  'https://<FUSION-URL>/config-sync/restore?branch=<BRANCH_NAME>&apps=app1,app2'
```

or

```bash
curl -I -X PUT -u 'admin:<PASSWORD>' \
  'https://<FUSION-URL>/config-sync/restore?commit=<COMMIT_SHA>&apps=app1,app2'
```

## Track the restore progress

Each restore operation is asynchronous. You can track the restore progress by checking logs in the ConfigSync pod.

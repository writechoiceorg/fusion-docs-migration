ConfigSync keeps your Fusion configuration settings consistent and up-to-date across different environments by automatically synchronizing configuration data between your Git repository and your Fusion cluster.
It follows [GitOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/gitops/) principles by using Git as the single source of truth for configuration management.

<Note>
TLS must be disabled in order to use ConfigSync.

## Features

ConfigSync supports these features:

* Configuration storage

  + Git Repository: Stores the configuration files.
  + Fusion Cluster: Applies the configuration files to the Fusion cluster.
  + Kubernetes Secret: Stores the Fusion secrets.
* Synchronization mechanisms

  + Polling:

    - Periodically pulls the latest changes from the Git repository and applies them to the Fusion cluster.
    - Periodically pulls the latest changes from some solr collections (blobs, rules) and pushes them to the Git repository.
  + Event-driven:

    - Listens for changes in the Fusion cluster and pushes them to the Git repository.
    - Listens for changes in the Kubernetes secret and syncs them with the Fusion cluster.
* Synchronization modes

  + [Publisher mode](/fusion/5.9/b1rtue/publisher-mode): Monitors Fusion for changes and pushes them to a Git repository.
  + [Subscriber mode](/fusion/5.9/t51vvb/subscriber-mode): Polls a Git repository for changes and applies them to Fusion.
  + [Pub/Sub mode](/fusion/5.9/r0xnd3/pub-sub-mode): Combines the features of both Publisher and Subscriber modes.
* [Secret management](docs/secrets-management.md)

  + Supports storing Fusion secrets in a Kubernetes secret and syncing them with the Git repository.
  + Watches for changes in the Kubernetes secret and syncs them with the Fusion cluster.
* [Version control](docs/commits-management.md)

  + Maintains the `latest-synced-commit` to track the last applied commit.
  + Supports locking the configuration to a specific commit using `locked-commit`.
* Restoring configuration

  + Allows rollback to a previous state.
  + Supports restoring the configurations to a specific commit, branch or date.
* Metrics

  + Exposes metrics such as `resource_update_errors_total`, `out_of_sync`, `sync_seconds`, and `sync_seconds_max` at the `/actuator/prometheus `endpoint.

## Setup

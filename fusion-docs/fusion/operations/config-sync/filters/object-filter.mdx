You can configure which objects to synchronize using the `objects` config setting in the `fusion-config-sync` section of the Helm chart.

## Enabled/disabled objects

Each object type can be disabled for synchronization using the `cfg.sub.objects.<TYPE-KEY>.enabled` setting.

For instance, to disable synchronization of the `users` object type, use the following configuration:

```yaml
cfg:
  sub:
    objects:
      users:
        enabled: false
```

By default, all object types are enabled for synchronization.

## Name filters

Each object type can have a name filter regex (`cfg.sub.objects.<TYPE-KEY>.name-filter` setting) that filters out objects by their name.
The global name filter regex for all object types is `cfg.sub.objects.name-filter` setting.

For instance, to exclude all objects with names starting with `test` for the `users` object type, use the following configuration:

```yaml
cfg:
  sub:
    objects:
      users:
        name-filter: "^test.*"
```

## Prop filters

Each object type can have a prop filter list (`cfg.pub.objects.<TYPE-KEY>.prop-filter` setting) that filters out object properties.

<Note>
[Subscriber mode](/fusion/5.9/t51vvb/subscriber-mode) does not support prop filters.
</Note>

The prop filter list is a comma-separated list of property JSON Pointer paths.
Read more about JSON Pointer syntax [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901).
The global prop filter list for all object types is `cfg.pub.objects.prop-filter` setting.
For instance, to exclude the `password` property for the `users` object type, use the following configuration:

```yaml
cfg:
  pub:
    objects:
      users:
        prop-filter: "/password"
```

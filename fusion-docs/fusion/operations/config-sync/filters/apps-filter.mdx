You can configure which apps to synchronize using the `sync.apps` config setting in the `fusion-config-sync` section of the Helm chart.
Apps can either be excluded or included.
For instance, to exclude application `app1` from synchronization, use the following configuration:

```yaml
cfg:
  sync:
    apps: "-app1"
```

To include only `app1` and `app2` for synchronization, use the following

```yaml
cfg:
  sync:
    apps: "app1,app2"
```

To include all apps for synchronization, use the following

```yaml
cfg:
  sync:
    apps: "*"
```

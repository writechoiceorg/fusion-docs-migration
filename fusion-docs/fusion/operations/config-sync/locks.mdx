ConfigSync uses locks to prevent concurrent access to the same repository from multiple ConfigSync instances.
The lock is a file named `.lock` in the root of the repository.
The lock file contains a UUID that is generated when the lock is acquired.

Each time on startup, ConfigSync checks if the lock file exists in the repository and the file contents match the UUID
in the `config-sync.branch-lock` Fusion configuration property (stored in ZooKeeper).

* If the lock file does not exist, ConfigSync creates it and writes the UUID to the file.
* If the Fusion configuration property is not set, ConfigSync sets the UUID in the `config-sync.branch-lock` property to the UUID in the lock file.
* If the lock file exists and the UUID in the file matches the UUID in the `config-sync.branch-lock` Fusion configuration, ConfigSync continues to work with the repository; otherwise it fails to start.

If you encounter an error like `App lock <SOME-UUID> doesnâ€™t match git lock <SOME-OTHER-UUID>`, see [Delete the ConfigSync lock file](/how-to/config-sync/7hd7pv/delete-the-config-sync-lock-file).

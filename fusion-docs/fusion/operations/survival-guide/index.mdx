The purpose of this guide is to help you install, configure, and run Fusion 5 in production with high availability on Kubernetes. You can also find this guide in the [fusion-cloud-native repo](https://github.com/lucidworks/fusion-cloud-native/).

<Note>
The Fusion 5 Survival Guide prefers Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) terminology. Although your Kubernetes providerâ€™s terminology may differ, the general concepts are consistent between providers.

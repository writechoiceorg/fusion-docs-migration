In addition to the basic query enhancement features, Fusion has some advanced query enhancement features that are best configured by data scientists or the Lucidworks Professional Services team:

* [Smart Answers](/fusion/5.9/461/smart-answers) analyzes your question-and-answer content to produce data that can power virtual assistants or chatbots.
* Fusion includes pre-trained [Sentiment Analysis and Prediction](/fusion/5.9/453/sentiment-analysis-and-prediction) models to assist with the interpretation of queries or content to determine some of their subjective aspects, such as emotions, intentions, opinions, and so on, using machine learning.

The Supervised solution consists of two parts.

## 1. Train a model

Train a deep learning model using existing query/response pairs by configuring the Smart Answers Supervised Training job. See [Train A Smart Answers Supervised Model](/how-to/652/train-a-smart-answers-supervised-model).

The job includes an auto-tuning feature that seeks to identify the optimal configuration for your RNN-based model. Transformer-based models like BERT are not used in the auto-tuning.

## 2. Create collections in Milvus

In order to use `{app_name}-smart-answers` pipelines, you need to create collections in Milvus. Please, refer to the [Milvus](/fusion/5.9/8821/milvus) documentation page.

## 3. Configure the pipelines

The trained model should be used at both index and query time in order to perform dense vector search.

* At index time, we provide the `{app_name}-smart-answers` index pipeline to help generate a dense vector representation of answers.
* At query time, we provide a `{app_name}-smart-answers` query pipeline to conduct run-time neural search. This pipeline transforms the incoming query into a dense vector using the trained model, then compares it with indexed answer dense vectors by computing the cosine distance between them. You can also use a query stage to combine Solr and document vector similarity scores at query time.

See [Configure The Smart Answers Pipelines](/how-to/918/configure-the-smart-answers-pipelines-5-3-and-later). Once your pipelines are configured, see [Evaluate a Smart Answers Query Pipeline](/how-to/653/evaluate-a-smart-answers-query-pipeline) to test its effectiveness so that you can fine-tune the configuration.

Getting data out of Fusion can mean querying your content or your signals, or accessing other data for analytics.

## Querying Fusion

Querying Fusion means sending a request to Fusionâ€™s [Query API endpoints](/fusion/5.9/361/query-profiles-api), specifying the query profile and any Solr query parameters. The request is processed by the query pipeline associated with the specified profile, and the response includes any enhancements configured in the query pipeline. You can also enter queries in the [Query Workbench](/fusion/5.9/167/query-workbench) to test your query pipeline.

Start by learning [the basics of querying](/fusion/5.9/168/query-basics), then about the out-of-the-box [query enhancement features](/fusion/5.9/3236/query-enhancement). For even more sophisticated personalization of search results, see [Advanced Query Enhancement](/fusion/5.9/3233/advanced-query-enhancement).

## Data analytics

Fusion provides search and analytic functions that allow you to:

* Explore and analyze the data retrieved
* Run standard reports and create custom reports
* Confirm the search results are what you intended to retrieve
* Verify the accuracy of the results
* Enable and run enhanced query options that can power virtual assistants and chatbots
* Run options to assist with predictive analysis

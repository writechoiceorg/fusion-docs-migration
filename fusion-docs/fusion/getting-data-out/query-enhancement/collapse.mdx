You can configure the [Query Fields stage](/fusion/5.9/289/query-fields-stage) to collapse search results based on a field, such as `product_id`, to group all variations of each item into a single search result.
This is useful for ecommerce sites where you want to show a single product with multiple SKUs or variations.

You can also control how Fusion selects the variation that represents the collapsed group; the default is the one most relevant to the userâ€™s query.
For example, a user who searches for "red shoes" sees all of the red variations of shoes first, with the option to drill down and see all the variations.

The Misspelling Detection feature maps misspellings to their corrected spellings. When Fusion receives a query containing a known misspelling, it rewrites the query using the corrected spelling in order to return relevant results instead of an empty or irrelevant results set.

Spelling corrections are applied in the [Text Tagger stage](/fusion/5.9/520/text-tagger-stage) of the query pipeline.

The [Token and Phrase Spell Correction job](/fusion/5.9/566/token-and-phrase-spell-correction-job) automatically creates spelling corrections based on your AI-generated data. When you navigate to **Relevance** > **Rules** > **Rewrite** and select the **Misspelling** tab, the application displays the **Misspelling Detection** screen.

You can:

* [Review or edit](/how-to/udlsjt/use-misspelling-detection#review) the output from the job
* [Manually add new spelling corrections](/how-to/udlsjt/use-misspelling-detection#add-new)
* [Publish changes](/how-to/udlsjt/use-misspelling-detection#publish) from the `_query_rewrite_staging` collection

When you manually add new spelling corrections, subsequent job runs use those documents as input for machine learning to improve the jobâ€™s output. Unlike job-generated documents, manually-added query rewriting documents are never overwritten by new job output.

<Tip>
Misspelled terms are completely replaced by their corrected terms. If you want to expand the query to include all alternative terms, set the synonyms to bi-directional. See [Synonym Detection](/fusion/5.9/8803/synonym-detection) for more information.

Fusion collections are Solr collections that are managed by Fusion.
Solr itself manages a set of [resources](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Managed+Resources) for a collection.

Stopword lists are one such resource.

Stopwords are words that are filtered out of a user-entered search request. Examples of common English stopwords are *a*, *an*, and *the*.

The Fusion UI provides a stopwords manager tool that is reached from the **Stopwords** page in the **Collections** menu.
This tool lets you view the contents of all configured stopwords files in an editable browser.

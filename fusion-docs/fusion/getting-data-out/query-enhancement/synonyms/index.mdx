Synonyms are interchangeable terms that can be used to expand a query to retrieve more or better search results. For example, "TV" and "television" can be considered synonyms. When a user enters one of these terms, Fusion can also look for results containing the other term.

More specifically, synonyms are:

* Words that mean the same thing, within the context where they are used.
* Used in searches. And synonym expansion allows Fusion to return results that match the meaning of the query terms, but not the words themselves.
* Important for mapping query terms such as:

  + Acronyms to their names
  + Jargon to public terms
  + Misspellings to correct spellings
  + Old to new personal or corporate names
  + Bridging the gap between the user vocabulary and terms in the original text

Fusion uses the Solr `synonyms.txt` and Solr collections, which are managed by Fusion.

Solr itself manages a set of [resources](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Managed+Resources) to apply synonym expansion, with configuration through the Fusion API and the Fusion UI.
However, Fusion synonyms are not interchangeable with Solr synonyms files.

If you have a Fusion license, see also the [Synonym Detection Jobs](/fusion/5.9/8803/synonym-detection-jobs) which automatically detects synonyms to use in [query rewriting](/fusion/5.9/489/query-rewriting).

## Synonym types

There are three kinds of search synonyms, depending on the requirements of the search for each specific term.

### Replacement synonyms

Replacements are used to change the query, to replace it with a more standard term or terms. For example:

```
lucid => lucidworks
```

In this case, "lucid" by itself not an approved term, so there should be no instances where the company name is a partial word.

### One-way expansion synonyms

One-way expansions expand original terms with more standard terms while retaining the original term. However, they do not do the opposite, meaning they do not expand standard terms to the original non-standard terms:

```
monitor => monitor, display
```

In this case, "display" is the standard term, but "monitor" is the original term.

### Multi-way expansion synonyms

Where each term is considered equally standard, multi-way synonyms expand the query so any items with any of the terms is retrieved:

```
login,logon,signin,signon
```

This example shows terms that are used interchangeably by authors. For this search engine, there is no need to distinguish among them, and considerable value in increasing recall to find all items discussing this topic. However, other content stores may use them differently.
Note that "logging" and "signing" have specific meanings in many contexts, so they might not be candidates for synonyms.

Example of synonym expansion:

<table class="tableblock frame-all grid-all stretch">
  <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%;" />
    <col style="width: 50%;" />
  </colgroup>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">Results before synonyms</th>
      <th class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">Results after synonyms</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">
        <p class="tableblock">
          <span class="image">
            <img
              src="/assets/images/common/synonyms-query-before-0-matches.png"
              alt="0 results for query &quot;logon&quot; before synonyms"
              width="98%"
            />
          </span>
        </p>
      </td>
      <td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">
        <p class="tableblock">
          <span class="image">
            <img
              src="/assets/images/common/synonyms-query-after-18-matches.png"
              alt="18 results for query &quot;logon&quot; after synonyms"
              width="98%"
            />
          </span>
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Viewing the query using the `debug=true` parameter shows how it is expanded:

```
 "querystring": "logon",
 "parsedquery": "(+DisjunctionMaxQuery((Synonym(_text_:login _text_:logon _text_:signin _text_:signon))))/no_coord",
 "parsedquery_toString": "+(Synonym(_text_:login _text_:logon _text_:signin _text_:signon))",
```

## Multi-word synonyms

To enable multi-word synonyms in Fusion, create an Additional Parameter stage for disabling the split on whitespace tokenization process (which applies to synonyms only):

```
 sow=false
```

Using eDisMax, this allows the new Solr SynonymGraphFilter to create the graph representations of token streams containing overlapping synonyms of varying word counts, and expand the queries with additional terms. If using a less-than sign (\<) with eDisMax, it must be escaped using a backslash.

Examples:

```
 appstudio => app studio
 signup =>signup,sign up
 login,log in,logon,log on,signin,sign in,signon,sign on
```

Multi-word synonyms work just like single-word synonyms, expanding the parsed query with additional query terms. For Solr details, see: [Multi-Word Synonyms: Solr Adds Query-Time Support](https://lucidworks.com/post/multi-word-synonyms-solr-adds-query-time-support//).

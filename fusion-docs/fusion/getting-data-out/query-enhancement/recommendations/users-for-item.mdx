Users-for-item recommendations retrieve the set of users who have interacted with an item, weighted by the number of interactions. This can be useful for community-driven use cases or for marketing campaigns. For example, on your organizationâ€™s intranet, clicking a search result could display the item plus a list of colleagues who have interacted with the same item.

This is one type of [collaborative recommendation](/fusion/5.9/475/methods-for-recommendations-and-boosting#content-based-vs-collaborative).

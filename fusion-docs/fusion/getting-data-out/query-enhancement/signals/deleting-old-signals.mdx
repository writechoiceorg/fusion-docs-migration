Signals are not automatically deleted by default, and over time they occupy an increasing amount of storage space.

To avoid running out of storage space as a result of your growing collection of signals, you must decide on a signals retention policy, then configure and schedule a [REST Call job](/fusion/5.9/384/rest-call-jobs) that regularly deletes old signals.

The duration for which signals should be kept depends on your use case and your organizationâ€™s policies. For example, in some cases signals could be deleted after 30 days, while in other cases they may remain useful for a year, or even forever.

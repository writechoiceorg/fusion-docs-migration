Predictive Merchandiser and Experience Optimizer are both AI-powered tools that provide insights, customer recommendations, and search optimization in a single comprehensive product.

Determining the best product for your needs depends on the type of materials you would like to tailor your search experience for.

## Experience Optimizer vs Predictive Merchandiser

Experience Optimizer is typically for Knowledge Management while Predictive Merchandiser is typically for eCommerce. Knowledge Management uses files and documents and wants to see additional text and links, with less emphasis on images. Online stores tend to put a greater emphasis on images than text.

In both situations, items chosen as most important are put into zones and shown for all users with natural search results below. You can pin important products, files, or folders as the first links.

| Product | Experience Optimizer | Predictive Merchandiser |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Layout | Optimizes list view | Thumbnail based grid view |
| Images | Small thumbnail; if no image available then show generic images | Larger images |
| Description | Page title with heading and excerpt | Less text, typically just a title |

## Choosing the right product for your needs

When you enter the **Rules** section from Fusion for the first time, you will initiate a wizard that will allow you to choose between two solution types, **Product Discovery** or **Knowledge Management**. From there, you will see your prospective workspace with predefined defaults.

Predictive Merchandiser makes it easy to group products together so they can be presented to the user. This can be useful when you want to show a product in all of its color variants or the various versions of a product (basic or advanced, for example).

<Frame>![Product Groups](/assets/images/predictive-merchandiser/product-grouping-example01.png)</Frame>

Product groups can be boosted or blocked. If you want to promote a product group that is on sale, for example, you can boost the group to the top of the results.

You can still apply rules individually to products within a group. This allows you to boost a product based on a specific userâ€™s search behavior. If a user typically favors the color red, you can boost the red variant of the product to the top of the group.

## Best practices

These parameters group products, and are defined in the Additional Query Parameters Stage:

| Parameter Name | Parameter Value | Update Policy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| group | true | default |
| group.format | grouped | default |
| group.ngroups | true | default |
| group.field | style_id_s | default<br/><br/>NOTE: You must configure `groupField=<field>` if you use [App Studio](/fusion/5.9/963/fusion-app-studio) to create your search application. |

For more information about adding a query pipeline and additional query parameters, see:

* [Additional Query Parameters Stage](/fusion/5.9/294/additional-query-parameters-stage)

### Collapse/Expand parser grouping

The Collapse/Expand parser allows grouping with the following parameters:

| Parameter Name | Parameter Value |
| --- | --- |
| expand | true |
| enableElevation | true |
| group | false |

See [Collapse and Expand Results](https://solr.apache.org/guide/collapse-and-expand-results.html) for more information.

* Pin, boost, bury, and block specific products in your catalog.
* Create business rules to display custom banners, or redirect customers to a different page on your site, for example.
* Create search rewriting strategies to manage spelling mistakes, synonym matching, phrase matching, and poorly performing queries.
* Review query rewriting strategies that were generated automatically using machine learning models in Fusion.
* Deploy new business rules and search rewrites to the Fusion data source where they can be triggered by live queries.

Sometimes, rules created in the [Rules Editor](/fusion/5.9/491/rules-editor) and Predictive Merchandiser conflict with each other. For example, if you have three rules to boost, bury, and block the same product, Predictive Merchandiser highlights these conflicting rules so you can address them.

To highlight conflicting rules, the **Rules Fired** section displays a red warning icon next to the dominant rule and a red flag on the conflicting rules.

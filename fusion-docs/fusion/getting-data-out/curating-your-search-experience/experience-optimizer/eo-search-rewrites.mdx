Search rewriting is a way of modifying search queries so that they more accurately reflect the intentions of your customers. You can create a misspelling search rewrite, for example, to correct a spelling mistake that commonly occurs when searching for a particular document. The misspelled query will then produce the same results as a correctly spelled search.

There are four rewrite types:

* [Head/Tail](/how-to/fn3y9z/use-eo-search-rewrites#head-tail) - improves poorly performing searches.
* [Misspelling detection](/how-to/fn3y9z/use-eo-search-rewrites#misspelling) - corrects common spelling mistakes.
* [Phrase detection](/how-to/fn3y9z/use-eo-search-rewritess#phrase) - identifies products with matching phrases.
* [Synonym detection](/how-to/fn3y9z/use-eo-search-rewrites#synonym) - includes alternative words with the same meaning.

In Experience Optimizer, you can create search rewrites manually. You can also edit, test, review and publish the search rewrites that are generated automatically in Fusion from signals data.

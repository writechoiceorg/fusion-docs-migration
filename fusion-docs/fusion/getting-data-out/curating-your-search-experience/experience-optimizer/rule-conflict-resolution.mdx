Sometimes, rules created in the [Rules Editor](/fusion/5.9/491/rules-editor) and Experience Optimizer conflict with each other. For example, if you have 3 rules to boost, bury, and block a document, Experience Optimizer highlights these conflicting rules so you can address them.

To highlight conflicting rules, the **Rules Fired** section will display a red warning icon next to the dominant rule and a red flag on the conflicting rules.

By clicking the **Edit** button, you can view the details of the conflicting rules so the conflict can be resolved:

The details of the conflicting rules affecting specific products are found in the document details panel. Click the **Start Task** button

Hover over a document, and click the **Document Details** button.

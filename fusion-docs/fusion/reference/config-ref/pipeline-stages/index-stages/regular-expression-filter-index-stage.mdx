The Regex Field Filter Index Stage (called the Regular Expression Filter stage in versions earlier than 3.0) removes a field or fields from a PipelineDocument according to a set of filters where each filter specifies a field name and a regular expression. If a field value matches the regular expression, the field is deleted from the document. The regex patterns follow [Java regular expression pattern rules](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html).

## Example Stage Specification

*Create a regex-filter to find Social Security Numbers and drop them from documents:*

```json
{
  "type" : "regex-field-replacement",
  "id" : "ssnFilter",
  "skip" : false,
  "filters" : [ {
    "sourceField" : "notes_t",
    "pattern" : "^\\d{3}-\\d{2}-\\d{4}$"
  } ]
}
```

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

Data models simplify the process of getting started with Fusion by providing pre-configured objects to reduce the effort spent on basic starting tasks. This helps keep documents consistent between datasources and intuitive to the objectâ€™s type.

The Call Data Model Pipeline index stage is used to create a link between your document type (person, email, file, etc.) and your documents.

<Tip>
**Important**


This index stage must be placed *after* the **[Data Model Mapping index stage](/fusion/5.9/8840/data-model-mapping-index-stage)**.

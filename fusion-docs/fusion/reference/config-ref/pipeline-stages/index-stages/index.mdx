Index Pipeline stages are used to create and modify [PipelineDocument objects](/fusion-pipeline-javadocs/5.9/com/lucidworks/apollo/common/pipeline/pipelinedocument).

The detailed configuration article about each Fusion index pipeline stage is provided in this section.

Configuration details are found for each pipeline stage in this section.

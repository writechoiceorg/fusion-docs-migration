The Set Property Index Stage is used to set a value on a document, or into the Pipeline Context for downstream consumption
by specifying a series of simple matching conditions.
These conditions match against whether a field exists, and simple substring matches on the field contents.
For more complex logic, use a [JavaScript Index Stage](/fusion/5.9/243/java-script-index-stage).

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

This is a [response rewriting](/fusion/5.9/449/response-rewriting) stage that helps "de-bias" results by shuffling the top N results randomly. Since most users click on result #1 before #2, this stage is helpful for distributing clicks more evenly among the top N results. This stage must be used *after* the [Solr Query stage](/fusion/5.9/265/solr-query-stage) in your pipeline.

This stage is especially useful when combined with [experiments](/fusion/5.9/460/experiments), where a small percentage of traffic is given shuffled results to minimize position bias when using click signals for ranking. The [Response Pairwise Swap stage](/fusion/5.9/510/response-pairwise-swap-stage) provides an another method for minimizing this bias.

## Query pipeline stage condition examples

Stages can be triggered conditionally when a script in the **Condition** field evaluates to true.
Some examples are shown below.

Run this stage only for mobile clients:

```js
params.deviceType === "mobile"
```

Run this stage when debugging is enabled:

```js
params.debug === "true"
```

Run this stage when the query includes a specific term:

```js
params.q && params.q.includes("sale")
```

Run this stage when multiple conditions are met:

```js
request.hasParam("fusion-user-name") && request.getFirstParam("fusion-user-name").equals("SuperUser");
!request.hasParam("isFusionPluginQuery")
```

The first condition checks that the request parameter "fusion-user-name" is present and has the value "SuperUser".
The second condition checks that the request parameter "isFusionPluginQuery" is not present.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

The Logging query pipeline stage prints messages to the API log file; the default location is: `https://FUSION_HOST:FUSION_PORT/var/log/api/api.log`.

The verbosity of this message is controlled by the property `detailed`.
If true, then the current Request object will be pretty-printed to the log file.
If false, only the basic information about this stage will be logged.

In a production environment logging stages should be configured with
property `skip` set to `true`, if possible. Use of detailed logging
may impact performance.

## Query pipeline stage condition examples

Stages can be triggered conditionally when a script in the **Condition** field evaluates to true.
Some examples are shown below.

Run this stage only for mobile clients:

```js
params.deviceType === "mobile"
```

Run this stage when debugging is enabled:

```js
params.debug === "true"
```

Run this stage when the query includes a specific term:

```js
params.q && params.q.includes("sale")
```

Run this stage when multiple conditions are met:

```js
request.hasParam("fusion-user-name") && request.getFirstParam("fusion-user-name").equals("SuperUser");
!request.hasParam("isFusionPluginQuery")
```

The first condition checks that the request parameter "fusion-user-name" is present and has the value "SuperUser".
The second condition checks that the request parameter "isFusionPluginQuery" is not present.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

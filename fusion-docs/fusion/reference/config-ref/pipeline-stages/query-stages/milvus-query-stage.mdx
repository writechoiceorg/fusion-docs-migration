The Milvus Query stage performs vectors similarity search in [Milvus](/fusion/5.9/8821/milvus).

<Note>
**Deprecated**

This stage is deprecated in Fusion 5.9.5 and later. It will be removed in a future release.

Replace the Milvus Query Stage with [Seldon](/fusion/5.9/33ccfb/seldon-vectorize-query-stage) or [Lucidworks AI vector query stages](/fusion/5.9/owi8af/lwai-vectorize-query). These alternatives improve performance when updating response documents with vector similarity data.
</Note>

## Query pipeline stage condition examples

Stages can be triggered conditionally when a script in the **Condition** field evaluates to true.
Some examples are shown below.

Run this stage only for mobile clients:

```js
params.deviceType === "mobile"
```

Run this stage when debugging is enabled:

```js
params.debug === "true"
```

Run this stage when the query includes a specific term:

```js
params.q && params.q.includes("sale")
```

Run this stage when multiple conditions are met:

```js
request.hasParam("fusion-user-name") && request.getFirstParam("fusion-user-name").equals("SuperUser");
!request.hasParam("isFusionPluginQuery")
```

The first condition checks that the request parameter "fusion-user-name" is present and has the value "SuperUser".
The second condition checks that the request parameter "isFusionPluginQuery" is not present.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

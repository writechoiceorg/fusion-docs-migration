The Landing Pages query pipeline stage provides the mechanism by which specific search queries will be pinned to certain URLs.
This stage returns one or more URLs which can be used for redirection.
It does not preform a redirection; this must be done by the calling application.
The redirection URLs are returned in a separate section of the Fusion response object, with attribute name `fusion`.

This stage is configured using Landing Page Rules, which consist of the following:

* `keyword`. Words, phrases, or a regex.
* `mode`. Filtering logic applied to the query, one of:

  + `exact`. The keyword and the query must match exactly. This is case-sensitive.
  + `phrase`. The phrase matching on the items in the keywords list.
  + `regex`. Treat items in the keywords list as a regex
  + `match`. Must match every item in the keyword list, but does not require phrase matching.
* `url`. A list of URLs.

## Query pipeline stage condition examples

Stages can be triggered conditionally when a script in the **Condition** field evaluates to true.
Some examples are shown below.

Run this stage only for mobile clients:

```js
params.deviceType === "mobile"
```

Run this stage when debugging is enabled:

```js
params.debug === "true"
```

Run this stage when the query includes a specific term:

```js
params.q && params.q.includes("sale")
```

Run this stage when multiple conditions are met:

```js
request.hasParam("fusion-user-name") && request.getFirstParam("fusion-user-name").equals("SuperUser");
!request.hasParam("isFusionPluginQuery")
```

The first condition checks that the request parameter "fusion-user-name" is present and has the value "SuperUser".
The second condition checks that the request parameter "isFusionPluginQuery" is not present.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

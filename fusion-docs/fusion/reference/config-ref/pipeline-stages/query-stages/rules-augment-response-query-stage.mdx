title: "Modify Response with Rules Stage"
permalink: "537"
---

Most rules operate on the request, but some [rule types](/fusion/5.9/489/query-rewriting#types), such as banner rules or redirect rules, do their work when the response comes back. The Modify Response with Rules stage applies those rules to the response. For example, a banner rule can add a banner URL to the response before returning it to the client.

See [Rules](/fusion/5.9/8835/business-rules) for additional details about how to configure this set of features.

TIPS:

* The [Apply Rules](/fusion/5.9/535/apply-rules-stage) stage must be enabled as a prerequisite for this stage.
* This stage has no configuration keys; simply enable or disable the stage.
* Although this stage is available without a Fusion license, it is only effective after creating [rules](/fusion/5.9/489/query-rewriting) in Fusion.

## Query pipeline stage condition examples

Stages can be triggered conditionally when a script in the **Condition** field evaluates to true.
Some examples are shown below.

Run this stage only for mobile clients:

```js
params.deviceType === "mobile"
```

Run this stage when debugging is enabled:

```js
params.debug === "true"
```

Run this stage when the query includes a specific term:

```js
params.q && params.q.includes("sale")
```

Run this stage when multiple conditions are met:

```js
request.hasParam("fusion-user-name") && request.getFirstParam("fusion-user-name").equals("SuperUser");
!request.hasParam("isFusionPluginQuery")
```

The first condition checks that the request parameter "fusion-user-name" is present and has the value "SuperUser".
The second condition checks that the request parameter "isFusionPluginQuery" is not present.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

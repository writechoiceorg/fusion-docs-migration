The Solr Subquery query pipeline stage is used to query external collections.
The Solr Subquery stage runs a query and adds the results to the pipeline Request object.
The query must return results in JSON format, so that they can be added to the query pipeline.

This stage supports [asynchronous processing](/fusion/5.9/173/query-pipelines#async).

## Query pipeline stage condition examples

Stages can be triggered conditionally when a script in the **Condition** field evaluates to true.
Some examples are shown below.

Run this stage only for mobile clients:

```js
params.deviceType === "mobile"
```

Run this stage when debugging is enabled:

```js
params.debug === "true"
```

Run this stage when the query includes a specific term:

```js
params.q && params.q.includes("sale")
```

Run this stage when multiple conditions are met:

```js
request.hasParam("fusion-user-name") && request.getFirstParam("fusion-user-name").equals("SuperUser");
!request.hasParam("isFusionPluginQuery")
```

The first condition checks that the request parameter "fusion-user-name" is present and has the value "SuperUser".
The second condition checks that the request parameter "isFusionPluginQuery" is not present.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

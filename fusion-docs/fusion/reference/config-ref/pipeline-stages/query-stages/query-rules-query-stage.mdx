This stage looks up rules that have been deployed to the [`COLLECTION_NAME_query_rewrite` collection](/fusion/5.9/489/query-rewriting#collections) and matches them against the query. Matching rules that perform [query rewriting](/fusion/5.9/489/query-rewriting) are applied at this stage, while matching rules that perform [response rewriting](/fusion/5.9/449/response-rewriting) are applied by the [Modify Response with Rules](/fusion/5.9/537/modify-response-with-rules-stage) stage later in the pipeline.

<Note>
To trigger a rule that contains a tag, specify the tagname in the request URL of the user search app. See [Easily define triggers in tags](/fusion/5.9/8838/general-configurations#tags) for more information.
</Note>



See [Rules](/fusion/5.9/8835/business-rules) for additional details about how to configure this set of features.

This stage supports [asynchronous processing](/fusion/5.9/173/query-pipelines#async).

<Note>
Although this stage is available without a Fusion license, it is only effective after creating rules in Fusion.

## Query pipeline stage condition examples

Stages can be triggered conditionally when a script in the **Condition** field evaluates to true.
Some examples are shown below.

Run this stage only for mobile clients:

```js
params.deviceType === "mobile"
```

Run this stage when debugging is enabled:

```js
params.debug === "true"
```

Run this stage when the query includes a specific term:

```js
params.q && params.q.includes("sale")
```

Run this stage when multiple conditions are met:

```js
request.hasParam("fusion-user-name") && request.getFirstParam("fusion-user-name").equals("SuperUser");
!request.hasParam("isFusionPluginQuery")
```

The first condition checks that the request parameter "fusion-user-name" is present and has the value "SuperUser".
The second condition checks that the request parameter "isFusionPluginQuery" is not present.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

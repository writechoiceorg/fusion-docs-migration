permalink: "516"

This stage uses the content of the current document to query for similar documents, using [Solrâ€™s MoreLikeThis component](/solr-reference-guide/10368/more-like-this).

This stage provides content-based recommendations. For collaborative recommendations, use the [Recommend Items for Item stage](/fusion/5.9/514/recommend-items-for-item-stage).

See [Recommendations and Boosting](/fusion/5.9/475/methods-for-recommendations-and-boosting) for more information.

## Tips

* The incoming query must include an `id` field in order to get recommendations from this stage. The stage returns documents similar to the one specified by this field.
* Since these secondary queries tend to be large, this stage can impact search performance. You can improve performance by first [clustering your documents](/fusion/5.9/582/document-clustering-jobs), then configuring this stage to query a specific document cluster instead of all documents.

## Query pipeline stage condition examples

Stages can be triggered conditionally when a script in the **Condition** field evaluates to true.
Some examples are shown below.

Run this stage only for mobile clients:

```js
params.deviceType === "mobile"
```

Run this stage when debugging is enabled:

```js
params.debug === "true"
```

Run this stage when the query includes a specific term:

```js
params.q && params.q.includes("sale")
```

Run this stage when multiple conditions are met:

```js
request.hasParam("fusion-user-name") && request.getFirstParam("fusion-user-name").equals("SuperUser");
!request.hasParam("isFusionPluginQuery")
```

The first condition checks that the request parameter "fusion-user-name" is present and has the value "SuperUser".
The second condition checks that the request parameter "isFusionPluginQuery" is not present.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

A query pipeline is made up of a series of query stages that process incoming search queries.

A pipeline stage definition associates a unique ID with a set of properties.
These definitions are registered with the Fusion API service and stored in ZooKeeper for re-use across pipelines and search applications.

Fusion includes a number of specialized query stages as well as a JavaScript stage that allows advanced processing via a JavaScript program.

The detailed configuration article about each Fusion query pipeline stage is provided in this section.

Configuration details are found for each pipeline stage in this section.

The REST Query pipeline stage is available in Fusion versions 3.0 and later.

<Note>
In Fusion version 3.0 and earlier, this pipeline stage was called the Query RPC Stage. RPC is the acronym for Remote Procedure Calls.
</Note>



The notation to send text as payload in **Request entity (as string)** field is `<request.q>`.

## Query pipeline stage condition examples

Stages can be triggered conditionally when a script in the **Condition** field evaluates to true.
Some examples are shown below.

Run this stage only for mobile clients:

```js
params.deviceType === "mobile"
```

Run this stage when debugging is enabled:

```js
params.debug === "true"
```

Run this stage when the query includes a specific term:

```js
params.q && params.q.includes("sale")
```

Run this stage when multiple conditions are met:

```js
request.hasParam("fusion-user-name") && request.getFirstParam("fusion-user-name").equals("SuperUser");
!request.hasParam("isFusionPluginQuery")
```

The first condition checks that the request parameter "fusion-user-name" is present and has the value "SuperUser".
The second condition checks that the request parameter "isFusionPluginQuery" is not present.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

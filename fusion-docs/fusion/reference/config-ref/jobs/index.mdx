Fusion provides the ability to run jobs against your data collections.

To create or configure the jobs detailed in reference topics in this section, sign in to Fusion and click **Collections > Jobs**. Then click **Add+** to create a new job or select an existing job you want to configure.

The jobs described in this section have a `subtype` property with one of these values:

* [**"task".**](/fusion/5.9/183/tasks) Jobs of this type include the following:

  + [REST HTTP calls](/fusion/5.9/384/rest-call-jobs) that run REST/HTTP commands
  + [Log cleanup job](/fusion/5.9/387/log-cleanup-jobs) that deletes log messages from the system logs collection
* [**"spark".**](/fusion/5.9/187/spark-jobs) Jobs of this type process data and include the following:

  + [SQL Aggregation job](/fusion/5.9/8804/sql-aggregation-jobs) that injects user-defined parameters into a SQL template
  + [Custom Python job](/fusion/5.9/569/custom-python-jobs) that runs Python code using Fusion
  + [Custom Spark job](/fusion/5.9/383/custom-spark-jobs) that runs a custom JAR file
  + [Script](/fusion/5.9/386/script-jobs) that runs a custom Scala script using Fusion

These additional jobs also have reference topics in this section:

* Supervised classification jobs such as Build Training Data and Classification
* Recommendation Jobs such as BPR Recommender and Content based Recommender
* Cluster Labeling and Document Clustering jobs

<Note>
Jobs with the a subtype of `datasource` have configuration schemas that depend on the connector type. For more information, see [Connectors Configuration Reference](/fusion-connectors/2/fusion-connectors). You cannot create, run, or schedule `datasource` subtype jobs in the **Collections > Jobs** screen.

For conceptual information and instructions about configuring and scheduling jobs, see [Jobs and Schedules](/fusion/5.9/184/jobs-overview).

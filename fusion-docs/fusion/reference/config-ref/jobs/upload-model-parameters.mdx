The Upload Model Parameters to Cloud job allows you to take a trained model and store its training to a blob in cloud storage, such as Google Cloud Storage (GCS), Amazon S3 (S3), or Azure Blob Storage.

See [Creating the Upload Model Parameters to Cloud Job](/how-to/6o129t/creating-upload-model-parameters-job) for more information on creating the job and deploying a model with it.

<Tip>
With the release of Fusion 5.4, the [**Create Seldon Core Model Deployment**](/fusion/5.9/564/create-seldon-core-model-deployment) job has been updated in conjunction so that it can pull down the saved model blobs and use them in deploying a new instance of the model, allowing for easier transference and versioning of trained models for rollback and testing.

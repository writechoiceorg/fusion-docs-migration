<Note>
**Deprecation and removal notice**

This parser is deprecated as of Fusion 5.8.0 and is expected to be removed in a later version. Use the asynchronous Tika parsing method instead. For more information, see [Asynchronous Tika Parsing](/fusion/5.9/lo9hdj/asynchronous-tika-parsing).
</Note>

Apache Tika is a versatile parser that supports many types of unstructured document formats, such as HTML, PDF, Microsoft Office, OpenOffice, RTF, audio, video, images, and more. A complete list of supported formats is available at [Apache Tika](http://tika.apache.org/).

To perform image text extraction when **Include images** is enabled, install [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) in the server hosting Fusion.

This stage is not compatible with asynchronous Tika parsing.

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

<Tip>
**Important**


This stage is deprecated in 5.8.x and 5.9.x, and removed in 5.9.10. Use [Tika Asynchronous Parser](/fusion/5.9/lo9hdj/asynchronous-tika-parsing) instead.
</Tip>



A simplified Apache Tika parser more geared towards an Enterprise Search crawl where all documents are parsed in a forked Java Virtual Machine. If memory issues occur during the parse, such as an Out Of Memory condition, the connector job is unaffected.

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

The Plain Text parser can split a text file by lines or consume it into a single document.

Options for treatment of this filetype include:

* Plain Text Parser Fields
* Number of header rows to skip
* Split on line end or not
* Comment character
* Skip empty lines
* Charset

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

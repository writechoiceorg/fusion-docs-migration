Fusion accepts large binary objects (blobs) for upload, and stores them in Solr. Blob uploads are used to install models, lookup lists, JDBC drivers, and more.

## Blob Types

A `resourceType` query parameter can be used to specify the blob type. For example, specify `file` when uploading a text or CSV file, like this:

```bash
curl -H 'Content-Type: text/csv' -u USERNAME:PASSWORD -X PUT 'https://FUSION_HOST:FUSION_PORT/api/apps/APP_NAME/blobs/quickstart/EXAMPLE.csv?resourceType=file' --data-binary @/path/EXAMPLE.csv
```

The complete list of valid values for `resourceType` is below:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `banana` | A Banana [dashboard](/fusion/5.9/139/dashboards) |
| `catalog` | An [analytics catalog](/fusion/5.9/329/catalog-api) |
| `driver:jdbc` | A [JDBC driver](/how-to/916/upload-a-jdbc-driver-to-fusion-server) |
| `file:js-index` | A JavaScript file for use with a [Managed Javascript index stage](/fusion/5.9/217/managed-java-script-index-stage) |
| `file:js-query` | A JavaScript file for use with a [Managed Javascript query stage](/fusion/5.9/258/managed-java-script-stage) |
| `file` | Any uploaded file, such as from the [Quickstart](/how-to/660/quickstart) or the [Index Workbench](/fusion/5.9/158/index-workbench) |
| `model:open-nlp` | An [OpenNLP model](/fusion/5.9/221/open-nlp-ner-extraction-index-stage) |
| `unspecified` | A blob of unknown type  If no `resourceType` is specified on upload, "other" is assigned by default. |
| `plugin:index-stage` | An [index stage plugin](/fusion/5.9/159/index-stage-sdk) |
| `plugin:query-stage` | A [query stage plugin](/fusion/5.9/hbu2ug/query-stage-sdk) |

## The Blob manager

In addition to the [Blob Store API](/fusion/5.9/305/blob-store-api), the Fusion UI provides an interface to the blob store in the [Fusion workspace](/fusion/5.9/116/fusion-ui-tour#workspace) at **System** > **Blobs**.

* Click **Add** to upload a new blob.
* Select an uploaded blob to view, replace, or delete it.
* Click **Add** to upload a new blob.
* Select an uploaded blob to view, replace, or delete it.

### Blob editor

The blob editor gives the ability to edit blobs in the Fusion UI in a variety of formats:

* CSV
* Java
* JavaScript
* Python
* SCALA
* Typescript
* Plain text

Navigate to **System > Blobs**, select a blob, and click the **Edit blob** button to open the editor:

<Frame>![Edit blob button](/assets/images/5.2/blobs-json-edit.png)</Frame>

<Note>
* If the **Edit blob** button is not available, the blob type cannot be edited with the blob editor.
* For Fusion 5.4.x and later, JavaScript can be edited directly in the Fusion UI.
</Note>



The editor has several elements worth noting:

| Elements | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <InlineImage src="/assets/images/5.2/json-editor/copy.png"/> | Copies the JSON to the clipboard. |
| <InlineImage src="/assets/images/5.2/json-editor/paste.png"/> | Pastes the clipboard into the editor. Only valid JSON is accepted. |
| <InlineImage src="/assets/images/5.2/json-editor/expand.png"/> | Expands the editor to a fullscreen view. |
| <InlineImage src="/assets/images/5.2/json-editor/condense.png"/> | Condenses the editor to a compact view. |
| <InlineImage src="/assets/images/5.2/json-editor/save.png"/> | Saves the JSON in the editor and updates the blob. |
| <InlineImage src="/assets/images/5.2/json-editor/reset.png"/> | Resets changes made since the last time changes were applied. |

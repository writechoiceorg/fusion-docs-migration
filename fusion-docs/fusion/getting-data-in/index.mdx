There are many methods for getting data into Fusion, depending on the type of data:

* Your searchable content, [signals](/fusion/5.9/469/signals), and logs are all ingested by [indexing them](/fusion/5.9/155/indexing-your-data) in Solr.
* [connectors](/fusion-connectors/2/fusion-connectors), [machine learning models](/fusion/5.9/492/machine-learning-models-in-fusion), [JDBC drivers](/how-to/916/upload-a-jdbc-driver-to-fusion-server), [analytics catalogs](/fusion/5.9/329/catalog-api), and [Banana dashboards](/fusion/5.9/139/dashboards) can be uploaded to the blob store.
* The [Parallel Bulk Loader (PBL)](/fusion/5.9/452/parallel-bulk-loader-pbl-overview) can perform distributed reads on any data source that implements the SparkSQL (2.2.1 or later) Data Sources API.
* Though signals are normally indexed, you can also [import them](/fusion/5.9/3220/importing-signals).
* In some cases, you might find that itâ€™s best to use other ingestion methods, such as
  [Hive](/how-to/735/import-data-with-hive), [Pig](/how-to/761/import-data-with-pig), or pushing data to a [REST API](/how-to/865/import-data-with-the-rest-api) endpoint.

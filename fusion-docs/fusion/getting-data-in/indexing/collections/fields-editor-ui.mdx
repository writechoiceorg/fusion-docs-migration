The Fusion UI includes a space under Collections to edit Fields. Fields help build the schema file and are modified from Fusion with the Fields Editor UI. These fields define how Solr should interpret data in a given field and how to query the fields. You can find descriptions for these fields in the Field Type Definitions section of the [Solr Reference Guide](https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_9/field-type-definitions-and-properties.html) associated with your Fusion release.

To use the Field Editor, navigate to **Collections** > **Fields** and click **Add a Field+**.

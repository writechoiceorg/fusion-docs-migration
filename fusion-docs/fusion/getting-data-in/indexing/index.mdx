Indexing stores your data in a format that is optimized for searching. How you index your data is critical for ensuring that your data is stored in a format that is ideal for your search application.

* [Index pipelines](/fusion/5.9/162/index-pipelines) determine the details of the conversion.
* [Index pipeline stages](/fusion/5.9/8799/index-pipeline-stages) are the building blocks of index pipelines.
* The [Index Workbench](/fusion/5.9/158/index-workbench) is Fusion’s index pipeline development tool.

### Collections

Collections are a way of grouping data sets so that related data sets can be managed together. Every data set that you ingest belongs to a collection. Any app can contain one or more collections. See [Collection Management](/fusion/5.9/8831/collections).

### Datasources

Datasources are configurations that determine how your data is handled during ingest by Fusion’s connectors, parsers, and index pipelines. When you run a fully-configured datasource, the result is an indexed data set that is optimized for search, depending on the shape of your data and how you want to search it. See [Configure a New Datasource](/how-to/867/configure-a-new-datasource).

### Connectors

Connectors are Fusion components that ingest and parse specific kinds of data. There is a Fusion [connector](/fusion-connectors/31/datasources) for just about any data type.

Connectors are the out-of-the-box components for pulling your data into Fusion. Lucidworks provides a wide variety of connectors, each specialized for a particular data type. When you add a [datasource](/fusion-connectors/31/datasources) to a [collection](/fusion/5.9/8831/collections), you specify the connector to use for ingesting data.

Connectors are distributed separately from Fusion. For complete information, see [Fusion Connectors](/fusion-connectors/2/fusion-connectors).

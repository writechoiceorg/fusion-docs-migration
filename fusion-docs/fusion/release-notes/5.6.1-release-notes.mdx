## New Features

### Fusion Connectors

* Fusion 5.6.1 adds a new connector, the [Web V2 Connector](/fusion-connectors/tq6l3z/). This brings our Web connector from the classic framework to our V2 framework.

    The Web V2 connector retrieves data from a Web site using HTTP and starting from a specified URL.

* As part of our transition from Pulsar to Kafka, 5.6.1 returns the ability to [Remotely Launch a Plugin](/how-to/o9xois/remotely-launch-a-plugin).

## Bug Fixes

### Fusion

* The [blocked rule form](/fusion/5.6/259/block-documents-stage) now validates the "Parameter Name" when closing the modal. This fixes an error where blocked parameters in the Query Workbench could not be deleted via the UI.

* User with read-only access no longer see the [Quickstart](/how-to/660/quickstart) splash page, as they are unable to use it to create applications or other Fusion objects.

### Fusion Connectors

* The [AWS S3 V2 Connector](/fusion-connectors/8851/amazon-aws-s-3-v-2) connector is now able to crawl non-public buckets when the object key is not specified in the configuration.

### Predictive Merchandiser

* Rules page now displays correctly for users with only the [developer role](/fusion/5.6/126/roles#developer).

## Removals

Fusion SQL was removed as of Fusion 5.6.1. It is available for Fusion releases 5.5 and earlier.

## Known issues

* New Kerberos security realms cannot be configured successfully in this version of Fusion.

* A bug was discovered in the Spark 3.2.x component that prevents signal aggregation for signals stored in the cloud in Parquet format. For more information about the issue, see the [Spark bug report](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38318).

    <Note>
    This issue is fixed in Fusion 5.7.1.
    </Note>

* The link to the [Banana dashboards](/fusion/5.6/139/banana-dashboards) in the Fusion UI does not work. You can access Banana dashboards using a direct link at `https://FUSION_HOST:FUSION_PORT/admin/banana/index.html#/dashboard/`.

    <Note>
    This issue is fixed in Fusion 5.7.0.

## Improvements

* Remote connector jobs now have the ability to recover from temporary network interruptions.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug that caused errors with the Argo workflow due to an issue in the Helm chart.

* Fixed a bug that can prevent the Fusion indexing microservices from running with Transport Layer Security (TLS) enabled. Other microservices, which rely on the indexing microservice, were subsequently prevented from running.

* Fixed a bug with [Spark jobs](/fusion/5.7/187/spark-jobs) that prevented the deletion of the temporary `job-impl.jar` file. This bug resulted in excessive pod disk space usage. Now, the directory containing the file is deleted when the job finishes.

* Fixed a bug with the Smart Answers Supervised Training job that prevented a trained model from deploying.

* Fixed a bug in the Spark 3.2.x component that prevented signal aggregation for signals stored in the cloud in Parquet format. For more information about the issue, see the [Spark bug report](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38318).

## Known issues

* New Kerberos security realms cannot be configured successfully in this version of Fusion.

## Bug Fixes

### Fusion Connectors

* Fixed an issue to make gRPC max outbound message size configurable to prevent remote connectors from failing on large field sizes.

* Fixed an issue where a restart was required when the remote JDBC V2 connector timed out and did not restart correctly.

* Fixed an issue where the JDBC V2 connector failed to index data.

* Fixed an issue where the Connectors SDK delete-by-query that contains a NOT-EQUAL phrase did not delete the appropriate documents.

* Fixed an issue where the outbound access control list (ACL) object contained a reference to itself in the `outbound_ss` field by default. The plug-in that creates the ACL should enter that reference explicitly only when required.

* Fixed an issue where the connectors-backend service did not add the following fields by default to the LDAP ACL documents: `_lw_data_source_type_s`, `_lw_batch_id_s`, `_lw_data_source_collection_s`, and `_lw_block_start_time_l`. These fields are required by the LDAP plug-in to keep the list of ACL objects up-to-date.

## Known issues

* New Kerberos security realms cannot be configured successfully in this version of Fusion.

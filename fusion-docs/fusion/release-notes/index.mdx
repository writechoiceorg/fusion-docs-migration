Release notes provide detailed descriptions of the relevant changes included with each Fusion release, including new features, improvements, bug fixes, and more.

## Upgrades

Keeping your Fusion deployment upgraded to the latest version enables you to take advantage of the latest features, improvements, bug fixes, and addressed security issues.

See [Fusion 5 Upgrades](/how-to/upgrade-fusion-5/3svmoc/fusion-5-upgrades) for more information on the upgrade process.

## Deprecations and Removals

Every Fusion release adds or improves Fusion features and functionality. Occasionally, Lucidworks "deprecates" features, and they are no longer maintained, updated, or supported. Deprecated features should be planned for eventual removal. In many cases, new features are introduced which replace or improve the functionality of the deprecated feature.

See [Deprecations and Removals](/fusion/5.9/8855/deprecations-and-removals) for a list of active deprecations and removals.

How long do I have before the feature is removed?

Lucidworks gives a minimum of one minor release cycle before removing a deprecated feature. For example:

* A feature is deprecated in Fusion 5.2.0, so it will not be removed before Fusion 5.3.0
* A feature is deprecated in Fusion 5.2.1, so it will not be removed before Fusion 5.3.0

<Note>
Deprecations are typically made in major and minor releases only. Maintenance release deprecations are less common.

## New Features

### Support for Open Nashorn

Now your pipeline definitions can include your choice of JavaScript engine, either "Nashorn" or "OpenJDK Nashorn".
You can select the JavaScript engine in the pipeline views.
Your JavaScript pipeline stages are interpreted by the selected engine.

<Note>
While Nashorn is the default option, it is in the process of being deprecated and will eventually be removed, so it is recommended to use OpenJDK Nashorn when possible.

## Improvements

* Fusionâ€™s Remote V2 Connectors now support the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Application Load Balancer (ALB) for ingress.
  See [Configure Remote V2 Connectors](/how-to/ssl8ue/configure-remote-v-2-connectors#enable-backend-ingress) for configuration details.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue that caused the API Gateway service to return a `401` error code for `400` errors.

* Fixed an issue that passed redacted configuration values to Fusion, resulting in invalid configurations.

* Fixed an issue that sometimes caused intermittent errors in Machine Learning stages.

* Fixed an issue where the `sourceType` query parameter was not being conveyed to Lucidworks AI.

* Fixed an issue that prevented the correct display of some UI panels for non-admin users.

* Fixed an issue where the names of some of the configuration checkboxes for the Web connector were truncated.

* Fixed an issue with the Web 1.4.0 connector that, in rare cases, prevented the client secret from being saved.

* Fixed an issue that caused a `Class cannot be created (missing no-arg constructor)` error when a response document contained an undefined value.

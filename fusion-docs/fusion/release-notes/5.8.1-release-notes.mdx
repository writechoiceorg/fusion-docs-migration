## Bug Fixes

Fusion 5.8.1 fixes a bug in the Fusion 5.8.0 Helm chart that prevented horizontal pod autoscaling from working.

If you are not using horizontal pod autoscaling, you do not need to upgrade to Fusion 5.8.1. This release does not make any other changes to your deployment.

To use horizontal pod autoscaling in Fusion 5.8.1, follow these steps:

1. Add the metrics server to your Fusion 5.8.1 deployment.
2. Ensure the following changes are made your custom values YAML file for horizontal pod autoscaling:

    1. Add service limits to the `resources` object of a service. For example:

        ```yaml
        query-pipeline:
          resources:
            limits:
              cpu: "2"
              memory: "2Gi"
            requests:
              cpu: "500m"
              memory: "1Gi"
        ```

        <Note>
        Resource limits vary depending on your deployment. Use values specific to your needs.
        </Note>

        <Warning>
        Do not use horizontal scaling with Argo.

        Horizontal scaling is not available with the Argo workflow controller. Do not apply horizontal autoscaling, or any other type of horizontal scaling, to the Argo service.

        Applying horizontal autoscaling to Argo can cause unexpected behavior, such as pods being unnecessarily terminated, jobs failing to launch, or models failing to deploy.
        </Warning>

    2. Use the new keys and values to support autoscaling. For example, the key `targetAverageUtilization` is now `target`, which requires the keys `type` and `averageUtilization`:

        ```yaml
          autoscaling:
            enabled: true
            minReplicas: 1
            maxReplicas: 5
            metrics:
              - type: Resource
                resource:
                  name: cpu
                  target:
                    type: Utilization
                    averageUtilization: 10
        ```

<Tip>
To verify that horizontal pod autoscaling is running, use the `k get HorizontalPodAutoscaler` command. The output should resemble the following:

```
NAME                REFERENCE                      TARGETS   MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE

f5-query-pipeline   Deployment/f5-query-pipeline   1%/10%    1         5         1          84m
```
</Tip>

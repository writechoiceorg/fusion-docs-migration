## Improvements

* Fusion now supports Kubernetes 1.27. This applies to GKE, AKS, and EKS. It also applies to Rancher (RKE) and OpenShift 4 versions that are compatible with Kubernetes 1.27. Refer to Kubernetes documentation for version [1.27](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/03/17/upcoming-changes-in-kubernetes-v1-27/).

* Query service replica scaling has been improved.

## Fusion Connectors

* Updated the Web V1 (classic) connector library to resolve issues for certain JavaScript-enabled web pages. While Fusion was not vulnerable to the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) 2023-4863, the connector updates allowed Lucidworks to also acknowledge and resolve that publicly-reported CVE.

## Bug Fixes

* The connectors-backend service no longer fails to start when deploying to Openshift 4.12.

* Fixed an issue where the Transport Layer Security (TLS) for Fusion Microservices could not be enabled and used.

## Known issues

* New Kerberos security realms cannot be configured successfully in this version of Fusion.

## Improvements

### Fusion

* Fusion now supports Kubernetes 1.24. This applies to GKE, AKS, and EKS. It also applies to Rancher (RKE) and OpenShift 4 versions that are compatible with Kubernetes 1.24.

* Fusion now uses a custom Solr image called fusion-solr. This version of Solr is based on Solr 8.11.1 and adds functionality to support Fusion features.

* Upgraded Fusion to use Tika 2.4.1.

* Disabled browser autofill in Fusion data source configuration forms to prevent accidentally filling fields incorrectly.

### Fusion Connectors

* The recrawl process is updated for the LDAP ACLs V2 connector. For more information, see [LDAP ACLs V2 connector incremental crawls](/fusion-connectors/4selgx/ldap-ac-ls-v-2#incremental-crawls).

* As part of the transition from Pulsar to Kafka, the ability to [Remotely Launch a Plugin](/how-to/o9xois/remotely-launch-a-plugin) is returned.

* A new connector, the [Web V2 Connector](/fusion-connectors/tq6l3z/), is added. This brings our Web connector from the classic framework to our V2 framework.

* The [Kaltura V2 Connector](/fusion-connectors/pzv2ns/) is now available.

### Predictive Merchandiser

* Improved UI elements in the Predictive Merchandiser.

## Bug Fixes

### Fusion

* Fixed an issue where pointing a Fusion collection at a Solr collection with a different name breaks queries to `solrServer` in Javascript stages.

* Fixed an issue when adding a new Graph security trimming stage; now you can enter a comma-separated list of datasources in **Exclude Data Source ID(s)** and **Inclusive Data Source ID(s)** fields with spaces. For example, `ds1, ds2, ds3`.

* Fixed an issue where documentation links pointed to Fusion 5.4 version, instead of the currently used version of Fusion.

### Fusion Connectors

* The [LDAP ACLs V2 connector](/fusion-connectors/4selgx/ldap-ac-ls-v-2) is updated to reduce crawl bugs, prevent a false error from reporting when the crawl is stopped, and ensure permissions settings are kept in sync.

* Fixed an issue with network policies that prevented the Sharepoint Optimized V2 connector plugin from indexing some data.

* Fixed an issue with the ServiceNow connector where empty fields would cause an error and break the crawl.

### Predictive Merchandiser

* Made the text box size larger to make it easier to enter multiple Boost Queries in the Rules Manager.

## Known issues

* New Kerberos security realms cannot be configured successfully in this version of Fusion.

* A bug was discovered in the Spark 3.2.x component that prevents signal aggregation for signals stored in the cloud in Parquet format. For more information about the issue, see the [Spark bug report](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38318).

    <Note>
    This issue is fixed in Fusion 5.7.1.

## Removals

* Removed deprecated NLP Annotator stage from Query Workbench and OpenNLP NER stage from Index Workbench.

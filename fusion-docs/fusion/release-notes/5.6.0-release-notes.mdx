## New Features

### Predictive Merchandiser

Predictive Merchandiser users can now fire templates and rules at every facet level.

Hierarchical template triggers allow you to fire a search configuration template or rules at a parent or child level in a hierarchy, and even at a faceted level.

**Ways to use hierarchical templates:**

* For a sale on "Winter Coats," you can fire a template at the "Outerwear" level or at any of its children.
* For an overstock on a particular clothing size, you could fire a template directly at the “Women’s Outerwear, Size Small” filter.
* When rolling out a new company policy, you could fire a zone on all pages from the homepage down so everyones sees the most important links and documents for the new policy.

See [Predictive Merchandiser Templates](/fusion/5.6/3289/templates#hierarchical-template-triggers) for more information. For instructions on how to use Templates, see [Use Predictive Merchandiser Templates](/how-to/3293/use-predictive-merchandiser-templates).

### Fusion

* Users can now manage API keys from their browser. See [API Keys](/fusion/5.6/7zriph/api-keys) for more information.
* Added a new query pipeline stage, [Graph Security Trimming Stage](/fusion/5.6/zdzlfu/graph-security-trimming-stage).

  The Graph Security Trimming stage restricts query results according to the user ID as an alternative to [Security Trimming Stage](/fusion/5.9/272/security-trimming-stage). Whereas the Security Trimming stage has one Solr filter query per data source, Graph Security Trimming uses a single filter query for all data sources.

### Fusion Connectors

* Added a new connector, the [SharePoint Optimized V2 Connector](/fusion-connectors/3qqudu/sharepoint-optimized-v-2). The SharePoint Optimized V2 connector retrieves content and metadata from an on-premises SharePoint repository. This connector replaces the SharePoint V2 Connector in Fusion 5.6.0.
* Added a new connector, the [LDAP-ACLs Connector](/fusion-connectors/4selgx/ldap-ac-ls-v-2). This connector replaces the LDAP V2 Connector.

    + Logging via Pulsar has been removed.
    + The Log Viewer has been removed from the Admin UI.
    + [Remote connector support via Pulsar](/how-to/8869/use-a-remote-connector-with-pulsar-proxy) is no longer possible. This functionality will be replaced in a future release.
    + The ability to access Pulsar from the Subscriptions API has been removed. You are no longer able to create a custom subscription topic.

* [LDAP-ACLs V2 Connector](/fusion-connectors/4selgx/ldap-ac-ls-v-2) replaces the [LDAP V2 Connector](/fusion-connectors/69/active-directory-connector-for-ac-ls-v-2-configuration-reference).

* [SharePoint Optimized V2 Connector](/fusion-connectors/3qqudu/sharepoint-optimized-v-2) replaces the [SharePoint V2 Connector](/fusion-connectors/70/share-point-v-2).

## Known issues

* New Kerberos security realms cannot be configured successfully in this version of Fusion.

* A bug was discovered in the Spark 3.2.x component that prevents signal aggregation for signals stored in the cloud in Parquet format. For more information about the issue, see the [Spark bug report](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38318).

    <Note>
    This issue is fixed in Fusion 5.7.1.

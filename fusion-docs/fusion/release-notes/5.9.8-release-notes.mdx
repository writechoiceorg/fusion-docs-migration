### ConfigSync

Automatically keep your Fusion configuration settings consistent and up-to-date across different environments with the new [ConfigSync](/fusion/5.9/j47yes/config-sync) feature. By leveraging Git’s version control capabilities, ConfigSync eliminates manual synchronization, provides a historical record of your environments, and enables seamless rollbacks and forward changes. Highly customizable, it simplifies environment management while saving time and ensuring consistency.

ConfigSync supports:

* Polling or event-driven synchronization
* Multiple synchronization modes:

  + **Publisher mode:** Monitors Fusion for changes and pushes them to a Git repository.
  + **Subscriber mode:** Polls a Git repository for changes and applies them to Fusion.
  + **Pub/Sub mode:** Combines the features of both Publisher and Subscriber modes.
* Locking the configuration to a specific commit
* Rolling back configurations to a previous state
* Storing and synchronizing Fusion secrets securely in your Git repository
* Metrics for monitoring, such as `resource_update_errors_total`, `out_of_sync`, `sync_seconds`, and `sync_seconds_max`

ConfigSync is turned off by default and requires preparation of a GitHub repository. Learn how to turn on ConfigSync in your Fusion 5.9.8 cluster with the [ConfigSync deployment guide](/fusion/5.9/5gj79e/config-sync-deployment).

## Deprecations

For full details on deprecations, see [Deprecations and Removals](/fusion/5.9/8855/deprecations-and-removals#deprecations).

As part of our ongoing commitment to providing a modern, efficient, and secure product, Lucidworks is officially deprecating support for the Nashorn JavaScript engine in Fusion 5.9.8. Users are advised to use the OpenJDK Nashorn engine, a robust and actively maintained alternative, for all JavaScript pipeline stages.

The deprecation aligns with industry trends and ensures compatibility with modern tools and frameworks. OpenJDK Nashorn provides enhanced performance, improved support, and ongoing updates, making it the ideal replacement.

<Danger>
**FAQ**

How long will Lucidworks continue to support Nashorn?

Nashorn will remain available for at least 6 months from the release of Fusion 5.9.8. All Nashorn-related features and integrations will be removed in a release after this 6-month period.
</Danger>

To prepare for the eventual removal of Nashorn in a future release, Lucidworks strongly recommends beginning the migration of your pipelines to OpenJDK Nashorn:

* **Audit your code.** Identify all areas where Nashorn is used in your applications.
* **Plan your migration.** Transition your JavaScript pipelines from Nashorn to OpenJDK Nashorn. Be sure to thoroughly test compatibility with your configurations to ensure a smooth transition.
* **Seek support.** Lucidworks is available to assist with any migration questions or challenges. Please contact your Client Excellence team if you have any questions.

We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in this transition. Thank you for ensuring the continued evolution and efficiency of your workflows.

<Tip>
You can select the OpenJDK Nashorn engine in the pipeline views or in the workbenches:

## Improvements

* Fusion now supports Kubernetes 1.29. This applies to GKE, AKS, and EKS. It also applies to Rancher (RKE) and OpenShift 4 versions that are compatible with Kubernetes 1.29. Refer to Kubernetes documentation at [Kubernetes v1.29](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/12/13/kubernetes-v1-29-release/) for more information.

* The Jira and Confluence classic connectors now support GDPR mode.

* The Graph Security Trimming query pipeline stage now supports two new types of access control lists (ACLs) in addition to the main ACL represented by the `_lw_acl_ss` field:

    + A "deny" ACL list (`_lw_deny_acl_ss`).
    + A "share" ACL list (`_lw_share_acl_ss`) for connectors such as SMB that support it.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue that caused counters from discarded `query-service` instances to be propagated to subsequent days, leading to inaccurate numbers on the Consumption Dashboard.

* Fixed an issue that caused an NRT replica to be created even when `nrtReplicas` is set to `0`.

* Fixed an issue that caused Kafka poll timeouts and commit errors, primarily impacting the Sharepoint Optimized V2 connector.
* This release fixes issues with several V1 connectors:

    + Fixed an issue that prevented the Jira Cloud V1 connector from handling `429` errors correctly.
    + Fixed an issue that prevented the Jira V1 connector from indexing attachments.
    + Fixed an issue that prevented the Salesforce V1 connector from indexing data and applying security trimming.

* Fixed an issue that caused datasource jobs to time out prematurely when data takes some time to process.

* Fixed an issue that sometimes led to connector crawls becoming stuck in an infinite loop.

## Deprecations

For full details on deprecations, see [Deprecations and Removals](/fusion/5.9/8855/deprecations-and-removals#deprecations).

* The Fusion Search [Domain-Specific Language (DSL)](/fusion/5.9/8833/domain-specific-language-dsl) is deprecated in this release. Be aware that it can cause significant performance degradation in queries.

## Known issues

* New Kerberos security realms cannot be configured successfully in this version of Fusion.

## Platform Support and Component Versions

### Kubernetes platform support

Lucidworks has tested and validated support for the following Kubernetes platforms and versions:

* **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):** 1.28, 1.29, 1.30
* **Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):** 1.28, 1.29, 1.30
* **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS):** 1.28, 1.29, 1.30

Support is also offered for Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) and OpenShift 4 versions that are based on Kubernetes 1.28, 1.29, 1.30. OpenStack and customized Kubernetes installations are *not* supported.

For more information on Kubernetes version support, see the [Kubernetes support policy](/policies/7shln5/lucidworks-version-support-lifecycle#kubernetes-support).

### Component versions

The following table details the versions of key components that may be critical to deployments and upgrades.

## New Features

New Lucidworks AI pipeline stages are introduced in this release to enrich your index and search with [Generative AI](/lw-platform/ai/r7ai90/generative-ai) predictions:

* The [LWAI Prediction index stage](/fusion/5.9/bzik28/lwai-prediction) allows for asynchronous and synchronous enrichment that add predictions when indexing your data.
  See [Configure the LWAI Prediction index stage](/how-to/ua7khh/configure-the-lucidworks-ai-prediction-index-stage) for more detailed instructions about configuring this stage.
* The [LWAI Prediction query stage](/fusion/5.9/hnuyky/lwai-prediction) fetches synchronous predictions to add to your query response.
  [Configure the LWAI Prediction query stage](/how-to/6w8lxy/configure-the-lucidworks-ai-prediction-query-stage) explains in detail how to configure this stage.

See [Generative AI](/lw-platform/ai/r7ai90/generative-ai) for more details about Lucidworks AIâ€™s Generative AI capabilities, including pre-trained models hosted by Lucidworks.
You can also use [LWAI custom trained embedding](/lw-platform/ai/k1zkfn/custom-embedding-model-training) and [LWAI hosted pre-trained models](/lw-platform/ai/3vqfxe/pre-trained-embedding-models) with these new stages.

A new API endpoint, `/index-pipelines/{id}/async-enrichment/skip-pending`, can be used to clear the queue of outstanding asynchronous prediction index requests if needed.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue where some collections were not displayed in the Collections Manager if the system contained one or more orphaned child collections.
  Note that orphaned child collections are not displayed in the Collections Manager by design, but they are discoverable using the API or the Object Manager.

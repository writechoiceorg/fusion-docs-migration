## Bug Fixes

### Fusion

* Fixed an issue that prevented the logout option from being displayed if the "logout" button was clicked while creating or modifying an OIDC/SAML [security realm](/fusion/5.5/127/security-realms).

* Fixed an issue that caused the cursor to bypass the password field when using the tab button at login.

* Fixed an issue that prevented [App Insights](/fusion/5.5/456/app-insights) from creating custom reports.

* Fixed an issue that caused invalid language codes to be displayed in the [**Detect Language**](/fusion/5.5/210/detect-language-index-stage) index pipeline stage.

* Fixed an issue that caused the [job list](/how-to/853/schedule-a-job) to disappear after saving the job settings.

### Predictive Merchandiser

* Fixed an issue that caused console and facet elements to stretch too far across the screen.

* Fixed an issue that made the **+ Add** button unavailable to associate products with [zero results](/how-to/832/merchandising-zero-results).

* Fixed an issue that caused results to disregard sorting attempts.

* Fixed an issue that prevented facet ordering from working as expected.

* Fixed an issue that caused analytics chart cards to remain blank.

</Warning>

* The SharePoint V1 connector.

* Usage of the `with` keyword syntax in the [JavaScript Query Stage](/fusion/5.5/283/java-script-query-stage) has been removed, as usage can result in random errors. See [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/with) for more information.

* Child facet values have been removed from [Hierarchical Facet](/fusion/5.5/vfdq6w/hierarchical-facets) breadcrumbs in favor of displaying facet values, to avoid confusion.

## Known Issues

<Tip>
**Important**

Users may experience one of the following issues with Predictive Merchandiser within the Fusion 5.5 release:
</Tip>

* The [**Rules**](/fusion/5.5/491/rules-editor#rules) screen no longer loads in Predictive Merchandiser when importing an app after building from Fusion 5.5.
* After importing an app running an earlier version of Solr, newly-created facets do not appear in the [facet zone](/how-to/874/use-predictive-merchandiser-facets#add-a-facet).

    Workaround Steps:

    In the `solrconfig.xml`, all cache classes that use `solr.LRUCache` must be changed to `solr.search.CaffeineCache`. See [Cache Implementations](https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_7/query-settings-in-solrconfig.html#cache-implementations) for more information.
* Changing the **Sort by** order of results is not reflected in the results list.

## Known issues

* New Kerberos security realms cannot be configured successfully in this version of Fusion.

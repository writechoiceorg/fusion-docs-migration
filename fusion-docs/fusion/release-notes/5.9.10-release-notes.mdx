Fusion 5.9.10 is a [maintenance release](/policies/7shln5/lucidworks-version-support-lifecycle#maintenance-release-support-policy) that introduces enhanced capabilities for Neural Hybrid Search, that improve search relevance for ecommerce by intelligently blending semantic and lexical signals and optimizing result collapsing.
Support for Kubernetes 1.31 boosts container security and operational reliability, while the Spark 3.4.1 upgrade accelerates data processing and analytics.
Additional security updates and the new Apps Manager API strengthen system protection and give better visibility into licensing and usage.
Collectively, these improvements drive more accurate search, faster data workflows, and a more secure, stable platform—delivering clear business value across search, infrastructure, and data operations.

For supported Kubernetes versions and key component versions, see [Platform support and component versions](#platform-versions).

## What’s new

### Improved relevance with Neural Hybrid Search

Fusion 5.9.10 introduces the Neural Hybrid Query stage, enhancing Neural Hybrid Search (NHS) by refining how semantic and lexical scores are combined in search ranking.
This new stage works with Lucidworks AI to ensure that result collapsing and final ranking use a unified scoring approach, leading to more precise and consistent search results—especially in ecommerce, where selecting the most relevant SKU for a product is critical.

Key benefits include:

* **Smarter relevance ranking:** Combines semantic and lexical signals earlier for more accurate ordering.
* **Optimized result collapsing:** Ensures the best representative item is selected before final ranking.
* **Broad applicability:** Enhances search performance in ecommerce and other scenarios that use result collapsing.

The [Neural Hybrid Query stage](/fusion/5.9/mb500k/neural-hybrid-query-stage) differs from the [Hybrid Query stage](/fusion/5.9/fgbib5/neural-hybrid-query-stage) in a few ways. The new stage contains the following new fields:

* **Lexical Query Squash Factor** lets you input a value that squashes the lexical query scores from `0..inf` to `0..1`. This setting helps prevent the lexical query from dominating the final score.
* **Compute Vector Similarity for Lexical-Only Matches** computes vector similarity scores for documents found in lexical search results, but not in the initial vector search results. This setting can rescue orphaned nodes by finding docs which match lexically but are not in the vector results, and compute the vector similarity score for those.

This update provides a more intelligent hybrid search experience, improving relevance across a range of search applications.

### Support for Kubernetes 1.31

Fusion 5.9.10 introduces support for Kubernetes 1.31, bringing enhanced security, improved resource management, and better networking reliability.
This update strengthens container security, improves how custom resources are managed and filtered, and enhances the reliability of `kubectl` operations like `exec` and `port-forward`, especially in complex network environments.
By upgrading to Fusion 5.9.10, you can take full advantage of Kubernetes 1.31’s advancements for stronger security, streamlined resource handling, and improved system stability.

### Expanded support for read-only file system

Fusion 5.9.11 completes support for the read-only root file system feature across all Fusion services, strengthening protection against unauthorized changes and improving security posture in hardened environments.

All services can now be configured to run in read-only mode using Helm values, with writable mounts available for components that require write access.

To learn more, including which services have this feature enabled by default, see
[Enable read-only root file system](/how-to/ybijf6/enable-read-only-root-file-system).

### Faster, more efficient data processing with Spark 3.4.1

Fusion 5.9.10 upgrades Apache Spark to 3.4.1, bringing faster query execution, improved data transformation efficiency, and greater stability for distributed workloads.
This enhancement optimizes indexing, refines SQL query handling, and ensures smoother analytics workflows, enabling you to process large-scale data with greater speed and precision.

For more details, see the [Spark 3.4.1 release notes](https://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-3-4-1.html).

The Apache Spark 3.4.1 upgrade impacts jobs that use Python 3.7 behavior or compatibility, which may have automatically updated to Python 3.10.x and no longer function correctly. Update your code to ensure compatibility with Python 3.10.x and then test your Spark jobs in a staging environment before deploying to production.

### Enhanced security and stability

Fusion 5.9.10 introduces a new wave of security enhancements, ensuring a more resilient and up-to-date platform. This release includes critical updates across core services, including admin, frameworks, apps manager, classic connectors, and query indexing, reinforcing protection across the stack. Additionally, we’ve updated the `bitnami-shell` base image and upgraded `key-tools` to v3.0.2, further strengthening security and compliance.

These enhancements help maintain a robust and secure Fusion environment, keeping your data and infrastructure protected while optimizing performance for mission-critical workloads.

### Apps Manager API

The new [Apps Manager API](/fusion/5.9/xjhjxq/apps-manager-api) gives information about your Fusion license, entitlements, and usage.

## Bug fixes

* `Solr-exporter` pods no longer get stuck in an `ImagePullBackOff` state, ensuring they pull the correct image and start reliably.

* The `job-launcher` and `job-rest-server` services now start correctly in SSL mode, resolving an issue where missing dependencies caused failures during initialization.

* Fusion now returns all matching search rules and rewrites in Commerce Studio instead of just the first ten, ensuring complete rule retrieval and better compatibility between the two systems.

* Prometheus stage execution histograms and counters now include stage labels, making it easier to organize dashboards and interpret stage metrics without relying on auto-generated IDs.

* Resolved an issue in Fusion 5.9.4 where v2 connectors failed to start in certain self-hosted EKS environments, preventing timeouts and ensuring successful job execution.

* Increased the request buffer size in `lwai-gateway` from 250 KB to 5 MB, allowing large messages to be processed without failures.

## Known issues

* Deploying Fusion with TLS flags enabled fails in ArgoCD due to Helm chart rendering limitations.

  When using ArgoCD to deploy Fusion 5.9.10 or 5.9.11 with TLS options enabled, Helm chart rendering fails due to the use of the `lookup` function, which is unsupported by ArgoCD. This prevents ArgoCD from generating manifests, blocking deployment workflows that rely on TLS configuration.

  As a workaround, deploy Fusion without enabling TLS in ArgoCD-managed environments, or perform the deployment using Helm directly.
  This issue is fixed in Fusion 5.9.12.

* An issue prevents segment-based rule filtering from working correctly in Commerce Studio. This issue is fixed in Fusion 5.9.12.

## Deprecations and removals

For full details on deprecations and removals, see [Deprecations and Removals](/fusion/5.9/8855/deprecations-and-removals#deprecations).

### Webapps service

Fusion has deprecated the Webapps service.
In previous versions of Fusion, you could use this service to deploy an App Studio WAR file into Fusion.
As of Fusion 5.9.10, you should instead [deploy App Studio manually](/how-to/6nsbym/deploy-app-studio-enterprise-to-a-fusion-5-cluster-gke).

### Forked Apache Tika Parser

The Forked Apache Tika parser stage has been removed. Use [asynchronous Tika parsing](/fusion/5.10/lo9hdj/asynchronous-tika-parsing) instead.

## Upgrade and platform support details

Upgrading to the latest version of Fusion 5.9 offers several key benefits:

* **Access to latest features**: Stay current with the latest features and functionality to ensure compatibility and optimal performance.
* **Simplified process**: Fusion 5.9.5 and later use an in-place upgrade strategy, making upgrades easier than ever.
* **Extended support**: Upgrading keeps you up-to-date with the latest supported Kubernetes versions, as outlined in the [Lucidworks Fusion Product Lifecycle](/policies/7shln5/lucidworks-version-support-lifecycle) policy.

Check out the [Fusion 5 Upgrades topic](/how-to/upgrade-fusion-5/3svmoc/fusion-5-upgrades) for details.

*Fusion apps* provide tailored search functionality to specific groups of users.

An app is a named set of linked *objects*, including collections, datasources, index and query pipelines, index and query profiles, parsers, and more.
You can define security on a per-app basis using [roles](/fusion/5.9/126/roles) and
[security realms](/fusion/5.9/127/security-realms).

The **Create App** modal can be accessed by clicking Create App. When naming an app, the name must start with a letter and can include letters, numbers, dashes (`-`), or underscores (`_`), with a maximum length of 128 characters.

To edit an app, access the **Edit App** modal by clicking on the settings cog icon on the app tile. Click on the pencil icon by the app name in the modal to edit the app name.

Generally, you will create multiple apps for different purposes. You can view all of your apps in the launcher when you log in to the Fusion UI:

To enter the Fusion workspace for any app, click the app name.

In the Fusion workspace, you can hover over <InlineImage src="/assets/images/5.6/workspace-menu-apps-56.png"/> to switch to another app, create a new app, or return to the launcher:

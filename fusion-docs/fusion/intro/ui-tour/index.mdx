The Fusion UI gives you easy access to all Fusion features.

The UI service utilizes the API service, so each UI feature has an API equivalent. For programmatic access to the features you see in the UI, see the [API Reference Guide](/fusion/5.9/424/fusion-rest-ap-is).

<Note>
**LucidAcademy**

## Logging in

The Proxy service runs on port 6764 by default. Access the Fusion UI through the Proxy service. To log in, point your browser to this port on the Fusion host, for example, `http://FUSION_HOST:FUSION_PORT/`.

When you are the *first user* to log in:

Fusion prompts you to set the password for the "admin" account and agree to the license terms. All other accounts must be created by an admin.

<Frame>![Set the admin password](/assets/images/5.6/first-login-56.png)</Frame>

The first time you log in:

Fusion opens the [Quickstart](/how-to/660/quickstart), to give you a demonstration of Fusion’s most basic features. You can click **Exit the Quickstart** to close it and go to the Fusion launcher.

You can open the Quickstart at any time by navigating to the Fusion launcher and clicking **New here? Get started…​**.

<Frame>![Quickstart](/assets/images/5.0/quickstart-0.png)</Frame>

The brief tour below shows you how to find your way around the interface. For a more detailed tour, try the [Get Started](/how-to/880/get-started-with-fusion-server) tutorial.

## A brief tour

* The *launcher* is where you can view all apps in your Fusion environment and create new ones.
* The *Fusion workspace* is where you configure how an app ingests, indexes, queries, and analyzes data.

### The Fusion launcher

When you log in to Fusion, the first page is the Fusion launcher. This is where you create and launch apps:

<Frame>![Launcher](/assets/images/5.6/launcher-1-56.png)</Frame>

To return to the Fusion workspace, hover over <InlineImage src="/assets/images/5.6/workspace-menu-apps-56.png"/>, and then click **Return to launcher**.

See details about [creating an app](/how-to/847/create-an-app).

### The Fusion workspace

You can reach the Fusion workspace by clicking on any app in the launcher. When you enter the Fusion workspace, you find all the tools you need to configure the selected app:

* On the left side are the [app tool menus](#app-tool-menus), where you can find tools for working with your app.
* [System-wide tools](#system-wide-tools) are at the top of the UI. With the exception of the **Collections** tool, which allows you to switch between collections for your app, these tools do not concern your app specifically.

#### App tool menus

<Frame>![alt](/assets/images/5.6/ui-tour-part-1-56.png)</Frame>

On the left side of the screen are six menus where you can find tools for working with your app:

1. <InlineImage src="/assets/images/5.6/workspace-menu-indexing-56.png"/> **Indexing** (getting data in)

   The [Index Workbench](/fusion/5.9/158/index-workbench) is the primary tool for getting data into your app through the Fusion UI. It provides an all-in-one view of the components of a datasource. You can also access those components individually through this menu.
2. <InlineImage src="/assets/images/5.6/workspace-menu-querying-56.png"/> **Querying** (getting data out)

   For getting data out, the [Query Workbench](/fusion/5.9/167/query-workbench) is the main tool. It shows you a live preview of search results while you configure and fine tune your query pipelines.

   See also [Getting Data Out](/fusion/5.9/168/querying-overview).
3. <InlineImage src="/assets/images/5.6/workspace-menu-collections-56.png"/> **Collections**

   Manage your data collections and configure their features.

   See also [Collection Management](/fusion/5.9/8831/collections).
4. <InlineImage src="/assets/images/5.6/relevance-icon-56.png"/> **Relevance**

   Add or edit rules, recommendations, and signals.
5. <InlineImage src="/assets/images/5.6/analytics-icon-56.png"/> **Analytics Hub**

   View App Insights, run Experiments, or view your Dashboard.
6. <InlineImage src="/assets/images/5.6/system-icon-56.png"/> **System**

   Manage your system, including access control and logs.

#### System-wide

<Frame>![Top nav](/assets/images/5.6/ui-tour-part-2-56.png)</Frame>

On the right are menus for system-wide actions:

1. <InlineImage src="/assets/images/5.6/workspace-menu-apps-56.png"/> **Apps**

   Switch between apps or return to the app launcher.
2. <InlineImage src="/assets/images/5.6/collections-icon-56.png"/> **Collections**

   View the status of all Fusion microservices.
4. <InlineImage src="/assets/images/5.3/search-icon.png"/> **Search**

   Click the search icon and enter a query to find areas of the Fusion UI, objects, and related documentation. Clicking an object opens the [Object Explorer](/fusion/5.9/121/object-explorer).
5. <InlineImage src="/assets/images/4.0/icons/workspace-help.png"/> **Help**

   Access the documentation.
6. <InlineImage src="/assets/images/4.0/icons/workspace-alerts.png"/> **Alerts**

In addition to Lucidworks' proprietary technology, the Fusion platform incorporates a powerful stack of open source software.

* [Apache Solr](/fusion/5.9/3214/apache-solr) is the search engine at the core of Fusion. Solr stores your data in a primary collection for the data your users will search and auxiliary collections for signals, aggregations, and related data.
* [Apache Spark](/fusion/5.9/189/spark-operations) is the cluster-computing framework for large-scale processing jobs. These jobs can be turned into stepwise tasks and distributed across a cluster of computers.
* [Milvus](/fusion/5.9/8821/milvus) is a vector-similarity search engine integrated into Fusion. It stores the vectors produced by machine learning models and reduces Solrâ€™s workload.
* [ZooKeeper](/fusion/5.9/3213/zoo-keeper) is a distributed configuration service, synchronization service, and naming registry. Fusion uses a ZooKeeper [microservice](/fusion/5.4/195/fusion-microservices) to configure and manage all Fusion components in a single Fusion deployment.

## Machine learning with Spark

[Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) is an open source cluster-computing framework that serves as a fast and general execution engine for large-scale data processing jobs that can be decomposed into stepwise tasks, which are distributed across a cluster of networked computers.

Spark improves on previous MapReduce implementations by using resilient distributed datasets (RDDs), a distributed memory abstraction that lets programmers perform in-memory computations on large clusters in a fault-tolerant manner.

Fusion manages a Spark cluster that is used for all [signal aggregation](/fusion/5.9/590/aggregation-jobs) processes.

With a Fusion license, you can also use the Spark cluster to [train and compile machine learning models](/fusion/5.9/492/machine-learning-models-in-fusion), as well as to run experiments via the [Fusion UI](/fusion/5.9/460/experiments) or the [Spark Jobs API](/fusion/5.9/312/spark-jobs-api).

See [Machine Learning Jobs](/fusion/5.9/494/machine-learning-jobs) for details about each pre-defined machine learning job in Fusion.

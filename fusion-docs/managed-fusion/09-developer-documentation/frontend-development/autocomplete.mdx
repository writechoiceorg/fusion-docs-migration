Autocomplete, also known as auto-suggest, look-ahead, or type-ahead, is a feature that displays a list of common search terms that begin with, or are contained by, the query string. For example, the query "search technology" might result in an autocomplete list with results "search technology rocks", "i love search technology", and/or "this is a search technology company", depending on how the autocomplete has been configured. Like most other search components, Managed Fusion leverages [Solrâ€™s autosuggest](https://solr.apache.org/guide/suggester.html) component. Assuming auto-suggest is configured in the Solr config, it is sufficient to enable it in Managed Fusion in order to use the component.

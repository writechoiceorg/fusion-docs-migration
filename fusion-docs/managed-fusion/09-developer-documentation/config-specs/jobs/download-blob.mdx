Managed Fusion accepts the following types of blobs:

* Analytics catalog
* Connector plugin
* File
* Index stage plugin

* Managed Javascript (query)
* Open NLP model
* Other
* Query stage plugin
* Spark NLP model

For more information, see [Blob storage](/managed-fusion/5.9/03ti2e/blob-storage).

To download a blob, sign in to Managed Fusion and click **System > Blobs**. In the left panel, click the existing blob you want to download. When the blob information displays, click **Download**. Then you can open the file on your computer and modify it.

* **dir.** The directory where the blob is located.

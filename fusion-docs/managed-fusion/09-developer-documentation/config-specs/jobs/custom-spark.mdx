Custom Spark jobs run Java ARchive (JAR) files uploaded to the [blob store](/managed-fusion/5.9/03ti2e/blob-storage).

To configure a custom Spark job, sign in to Managed Fusion and click **Collections > Jobs**. Then click **Add+** and in the Custom and Other Jobs section, select **Custom Spark Job**. You can enter basic and advanced parameters to configure the job. If the field has a default value, it is populated when you click to add the job.

## Basic parameters

<Note>
To enter advanced parameters in the UI, click **Advanced**. Those parameters are described in [the advanced parameters section](#advanced-parameters).
</Note>

* **Spark job ID.** The unique ID for the Spark job that references this job in the API. This is the `id` field in the configuration file. Required field.
* **Class name.** The fully-qualified name of the Java/Scala class to invoke for this job. This is the `klassName` field in the configuration file. Required field.
* **Script ARGs.** The arguments (ARGs), which are additional options to pass to the application when running this job. This is the `submitArgs` field in the configuration file. Optional field.

## Advanced parameters

If you click the **Advanced** toggle, the following optional fields are displayed in the UI.

* **Spark Settings.** This section lets you enter `parameter name:parameter value` options to configure Spark settings. This is the `sparkConfig` field in the configuration file.
* **Scala Script.** The value in this text field overrides running `className.main(args)` default behavior. This is the `script` field in the configuration file.

<Note>
Alternatives to custom Spark jobs are [Custom Python job configuration specifications](/managed-fusion/5.9/fonqz2/custom-python) and Scala [Script job configuration specifications](/managed-fusion/5.9/vmzx60/script).

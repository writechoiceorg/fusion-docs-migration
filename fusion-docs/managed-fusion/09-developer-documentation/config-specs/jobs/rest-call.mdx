To create a REST Call job, sign in to Managed Fusion and click **Collections > Jobs**. Then click **Add+** and in the Custom and Other Jobs section, select **REST Call**. You can enter parameters to configure the job. If the field has a default value, it is populated when you click to add the job.

The parameters for this job are:

* **ID.** The user-defined name for this job. This is the `id` field in the configuration file. Required field.
* **Endpoint URI.** The name or location of the data this job searches. This is the `uri` field in the configuration file. Required field.
* **Call method.** The operation submitted in the request. Values are GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE. This is the `method` field in the configuration file. Required field.
* **Query parameters.** This section lets you enter `property name:property value` options submitted in the query. This is the `queryParams` field in the configuration file. Optional field.
* **Request protocol headers.** This section lets you enter `property name:property value` protocol headers submitted in the query. This is the `headers` field in the configuration file. Optional field.
* **Request entity.** The request string to submit for the query. This is the `entity` field in the configuration file. Optional field.

## Example configuration

This example configures this type of job to delete your old signals data:

1. Navigate to **Collections** > **Jobs**.
2. Click **Add** and select **REST Call**.

   The REST Call job configuration panel appears.
3. Enter an arbitrary ID for this job, such as "Delete-old-signals".
4. Enter the following endpoint URI, substituting the name of your signals collection for `signalsCollectionName`:

   ```
   solr://signalsCollectionName/update
   ```

5. In the **Call Method** field, select "post".
6. Under **Query Parameters**, enter the property name "wt" with the property value "json".
7. In the **Request entity (as string)** field, enter the following:

   ```
   <root><delete><query>timestamp_tdt:[* TO NOW-2WEEKS]</query></delete><commit /></root>
   ```

   See [Working with Dates](https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_6/working-with-dates.html) for details about date formatting.

   Your job configuration should look similar to this:

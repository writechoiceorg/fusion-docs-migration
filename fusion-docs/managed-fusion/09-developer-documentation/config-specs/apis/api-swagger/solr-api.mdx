The Solr API is used to manage collection-level configurations. The path for this request is:

```sh
https://EXAMPLE_COMPANY.b.lucidworks.cloud/api/solr/COLLECTION_NAME/SOLR_REQUEST
```

Replace `COLLECTION_NAME` with the name of a specific collection and `SOLR_REQUEST` with the Solr command you wish to run.

Since this API proxies requests to Solr, each available method corresponds to the method in Solr. So, a GET request to Solr would use the GET method of this endpoint; a POST would use the POST method, etc.

Depending on the request, the response may consist of records that match a query
or output from a Schema API request.

## Examples

Query Solr for documents in the 'docs' collection containing the term 'solr', limiting the results to only 2 records, returning only the title, and in JSON format:

**REQUEST**

```sh
https://EXAMPLE_COMPANY.b.lucidworks.cloud/api/solr/docs/select?q=solr&rows=2&fl=title&wt=json
```

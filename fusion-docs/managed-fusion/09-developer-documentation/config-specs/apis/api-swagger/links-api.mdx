The Links API manages the links that represent the relationships between Managed Fusion objects. You can see these links in the [Object Explorer](/managed-fusion/5.9/v90jze/object-explorer) by pressing CMD-K or CTRL-K from any screen in the Managed Fusion UI. You can also export and import links using the [Objects API](/managed-fusion/5.9/7ocb2u/objects-api).

Links are structured as a tuple of `(subject, object, linkType)`. An example would be `(foo, bar, dependsOn)`, which would read as "foo dependsOn bar".

For more information, [view the API specification.](?open-api=true)

## Link types and link reversibility

The possible values of `linkType` are as follows:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Trigger type</th>
      <th>Parameters</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>inContextOf</code></td>
      <td>
        <p>The subject exists in the context of the object, which is an app.</p>
        <p>In this example, the "Movie_Search" app is the context for a parser with the same name:</p>
        ```json
        {
          "subject" : "parser:Movie_Search",
          "object" : "app:Movie_Search",
          "linkType" : "inContextOf",
          "originator" : "unspecified"
        }
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>hasContext</code></td>
      <td>
        <p>The subject is an app that contains the object.</p>
        <p>In this example, an index profile exists in the context of the "Movie_Search" app:</p>
        ```json
        {
          "subject" : "app:Movie_Search",
          "object" : "index-profile:Movie_Search",
          "linkType" : "hasContext",
          "originator" : "unspecified"
        }
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>dependsOn</code></td>
      <td>
        <p>The subject depends on the object.</p>
        <p>In this example, a datasource called "web_pokeapi_co-default" depends on a parser by the same name:</p>
        ```json
        {
          "subject" : "datasource:web_pokeapi_co-default",
          "object" : "parser:web_pokeapi_co-default",
          "linkType" : "dependsOn"
        }
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>supports</code></td>
      <td>
        <p>The subject is depended on by the object (the reverse of <code>dependsOn</code>).</p>
        <p>In this example, a parser called "web_pokeapi_co-default" supports a datasource by the same name:</p>
        ```json
        {
          "subject" : "parser:web_pokeapi_co-default",
          "object" : "datasource:web_pokeapi_co-default",
          "linkType" : "supports"
        }
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>isPartOf</code></td>
      <td>
        <p>The subject is part of the object, where the object is a group.</p>
        <p>In this example, an aggregation called "click-signals-default" is part of a group called "signals-object-group-default":</p>
        ```json
        {
          "subject" : "aggregation:click-signals-default",
          "object" : "group:signals-object-group-default",
          "linkType" : "isPartOf"
        }
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>hasPart</code></td>
      <td>
        <p>The subject is a group, of which the object is a member (the reverse of <code>isPartOf</code>).</p>
        <p>In this example, a group called "signals-object-group-default" has a member aggregation "click-signals-default":</p>
        ```json
        {
          "subject" : "group:signals-object-group-default",
          "object" : "aggregation:click-signals-default",
          "linkType" : "hasPart"
        }
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>relatesTo</code></td>
      <td>
        <p>The subject relates to the object. This is a uni-directional relationship that associates two objects that have none of the relationships described above.</p>
        <p>For example, when recommendations are enabled for the default collection, Managed Fusion creates a group of objects which relates to the default collection:</p>
        ```json
        {
          "subject" : "group:recommendations-default",
          "object" : "collection:default",
          "linkType" : "relatesTo"
        }
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

With the exception of the `relatesTo` link type, links are reversible:

* `inContextOf` is the reverse of `hasContext` (and vice versa).
* `dependsOn` is the reverse of `supports` (and vice versa).
* `isPartOf` is the reverse of `hasPart` (and vice versa).

For example, here is the group of links for the `signals-default` collection:

```json
[
  {
    "subject": "group:4e6ee9a6-d4ab-413a-ac70-a27c1445bb60",
    "object": "collection:default_signals_aggr",
    "linkType": "hasPart"
  },
  {
    "subject": "group:4e6ee9a6-d4ab-413a-ac70-a27c1445bb60",
    "object": "spark:default_click_signals_aggregation",
    "linkType": "hasPart"
  },
  {
    "subject": "group:4e6ee9a6-d4ab-413a-ac70-a27c1445bb60",
    "object": "collection:default",
    "linkType": "relatesTo"
  },
  {
    "subject": "group:4e6ee9a6-d4ab-413a-ac70-a27c1445bb60",
    "object": "collection:default_signals",
    "linkType": "hasPart"
  }
]
```

When we request the links for one of the `hasPart` objects shown above, we get the reverse representation:

```
GET https://EXAMPLE_COMPANY.b.lucidworks.cloud/api/links?subject=collection:default_signals_aggr

[
  {
    "subject": "collection:default_signals_aggr",
    "object": "group:4e6ee9a6-d4ab-413a-ac70-a27c1445bb60",
    "linkType": "isPartOf"
  }
]
```

## Examples

**Get links to the default collection**

```sh
curl https://EXAMPLE_COMPANY.b.lucidworks.cloud/api/links?subject=collection:default
```

Output:

```json
[ { "subject": "collection:default", "object": "index-pipeline:default", "linkType": "supports" } ]
```

**Create a new link**

```sh
curl -X PUT https://EXAMPLE_COMPANY.b.lucidworks.cloud/api/links -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"linkType": "supports", "object": "index-pipeline:default", "subject": "collection:default"}'
```

Output:

```json
{ "subject" : "collection:default", "object" : "index-pipeline:default", "linkType" : "supports" }
```

**Delete a link**

```sh
curl -X DELETE https://EXAMPLE_COMPANY.b.lucidworks.cloud/api/links?subject=collection:default
```

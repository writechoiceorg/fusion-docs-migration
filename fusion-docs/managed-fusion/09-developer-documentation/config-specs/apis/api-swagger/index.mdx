This group of APIs can help you with the general management of your Managed Fusion instance. Use APIs to manage [App Studio](/managed-fusion/5.9/n2q1el/apps-api) objects. Use the [Configurations](/managed-fusion/5.9/31rfto/configurations-api) APIs to establish relationships between Managed Fusion objects, connect your Managed Fusion instance to [Solr clusters](/managed-fusion/5.9/i645q3/solr-api), and manage license files. Or, create a [history](/managed-fusion/5.9/q154ig/history-api) of service events, define schedules for [jobs](/managed-fusion/5.9/lggfzz/jobs-api), and more.

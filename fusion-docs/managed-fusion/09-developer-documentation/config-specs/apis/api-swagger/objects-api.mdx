The Objects API lets you import and export objects between Managed Fusion instances. Managed Fusion objects include all your searchable data, plus pipelines, aggregations, and other configurations on which your collections depend.

As an alternative in some cases, you can [use the Managed Fusion UI to migrate objects](/how-to/0imnej/migrate-fusion-objects).

<Note>
**Important**

For both the API and UI, migrating objects is intended for use *within a specific Managed Fusion version*. See [Managed Fusion 5 Upgrades](/how-to/upgrade-fusion-5/3svmoc/fusion-5-upgrades) to migrate objects from one Managed Fusion version to a specific Managed Fusion 5.x release.
</Note>

You can select all objects, or limit the operation to specific object types or IDs. In addition to export/import endpoints, a validation endpoint is provided for troubleshooting.

<Note>
By default, system-created collections are not exported. See below for details.
</Note>

For more information, [view the API specification.](?open-api=true)

## Object export and import

[Collections](#exporting-and-importing-collections) and [encrypted values](#encrypted-passwords) are treated specially; details are provided below. During import, conflicts are resolved according to the specified [import policy](#import-policies).

For objects other than collections, no implicit filtering is performed; all objects are included by default. However, on export you can [filter by type and ID](#filtering-on-export).

### Supported objects

Managed Fusion lets you export and import object types. ZIP files are the output for all file types listed. To filter by type, use the values below with the `type` query string parameter; see the examples below.

| Object type | Value |
| --- | --- |
| apps | `app` <Tip> The `deep` parameter is not needed for this object type. In the case of apps, all linked objects are included by default. </Tip> |
| Appkit apps | `appkit` |
| blob | `blob` |
| collections (with their dependent objects)  See below for collection-specific details. | `collection` |
| data-model | `data-model` |
| datasources | `datasource` |
| experiment | `experiment` |
| index pipelines | `index-pipeline` |
| index profiles | `index-profile` |
| job configurations | `spark`, `type`, or `data-source` |
| link | `link` |
| object group | `group` |
| parsing configurations | `parser` |
| query pipelines | `query-pipeline` |
| query profiles | `query-profile` |
| schedules for schedulable jobs (spark, type, or datasource) | `job` |
| search cluster configurations | `search-cluster` |
| subscription | `subscription` |
| template | `template` |
| zone | `zone` |

### Exporting and importing collections

Collections are processed with these dependent objects:

* features
* index profiles
* query profiles

Datasources, parser configurations, and pipeline configurations are not included when collections are exported or imported. These must be exported and imported explicitly.

Only user-created collections are included by default. Certain types of collections are excluded:

* the "default" collection
* collections whose type is not DATA
* collections whose names start with "system_"
* "Secondary" collections, that is, collections created by features

  Instead, create the same features on the target system; this automatically creates the corresponding secondary collections.

You can override these exclusions by specifying a collection, like this:

```sh
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD https://EXAMPLE_COMPANY.b.lucidworks.cloud/api/objects/export?collection.ids=default > collection.zip
```

### Encrypted passwords

Some objects, such as datasources and query pipelines, include encrypted passwords for accessing secure data.

* On *export*, these encrypted values are replaced with one of the following:

  + `secret.dataSources.datasourceID.password`
  + `secret.queryPipelines.pipelineID.stages.active-directory-security-trimming.stageID.bindPassword`
* On *import*, the original, plaintext passwords must be provided in a separate JSON map as multipart form data:

  ```json
  {
    "secret.dataSources.datasourceID.password":"MyDatasourcePassword",
    "secret.queryPipelines.pipelineID.stages.active-directory-security-trimming.stageID.bindPassword":"MyADPassword"
  }
  ```

  <Tip>
  Passwords can also be [uploaded via the UI](/how-to/0imnej/migrate-fusion-objects#import-objects-into-an-app).
  Variables that do not start with `secret.` are ignored.
  </Tip>

### Import policies

On import, the `importPolicy` parameter is required. It specifies what to do if any object in the import list already exists on the target system:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| `abort` | If there are conflicts, then import nothing. |
| `merge` | If there are conflicts, then skip the conflicting objects. |
| `overwrite` | If there are conflicts, then overwrite or delete/create the conflicting objects on the target system. |

### Filtering on export

On export, there are two ways to specify the objects to include:

* by type

  To export only specific types of objects, you can specify one or more object types using the `type` query string parameter. See [Supported objects](#types) for a list of valid values.
* by type and ID

  The `type.ids` parameter lets you list the IDs to match for the specified object type.

The `type` and `type.ids` parameters can be combined as needed.

### Exporting linked objects

Related Managed Fusion objects are linked. You can view linked objects using the [Links API](/managed-fusion/5.9/v2flhi/links-api) or the [Object Explorer](/managed-fusion/5.9/v90jze/object-explorer).

When exporting a specific Managed Fusion object, you can also export its linked objects without specifying each one individually. To export all objects linked to the specified object, include the `deep="true"` query parameter in your request. See the [example](#export-examples-linked) below.

## Validation

Objects are validated before import. If any objects fail validation, the whole import request is rejected. A separate endpoint is available for validating objects without importing them.

Validation includes checking whether an object already exists on the target system and whether the user is authorized to create or modify the object.

For collection objects, the following special validation is performed:

* We check the `searchClusterId` of each collection and verify that a cluster with this ID exists on the target system or in the import file (error).
* We check that features, index profiles, and query profiles belong only to the collections specified in the import file (error).
* We check that a feature exists on the target system for each feature in the import file (error).
* We check for index profiles or query profiles that do not exist on the target system or in the import file (warning).

## Status messages

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| `Validation completed with no errors` | The validation method was called and no errors found, though there may be warnings. |
| `Validation found errors` | The validation was called and errors found. Validation does not stop on the first error, so the complete list of errors is reported. |
| `Validation was not completed because of system error` | The validation was interrupted by system error. |
| `Import was not performed because validation errors exist` | The import method was called, but import didn’t start because of validation errors. |
| `Import was not performed because of input data error` | The import method was called, but import didn’t start, because Managed Fusion could not find a substitution for one of the secret values in objects in import. |
| `Import was not completed because of system error` | The validation found no errors and import started, but it was interrupted by system error. |
| `Import was completed` | Validation found no errors and import finished successfully. |

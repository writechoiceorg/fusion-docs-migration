The Sessions API provides a way for clients to manage Managed Fusion sessions and cookies. When a client successfully authenticates, Managed Fusion will create a unique identifier for the session. This identifier becomes the session key and is mapped to the client. The authentication response contains an HTTP cookie, which is typically stored by the client for later use. By sending this cookie back to Managed Fusion, a client can securely access Managed Fusion without having to re-authenticate.

<Note>
The Sessions API is useful for performance and repeatability.

For more information, [view the API specification.](?open-api=true)

By default, sessions time out after 30 minutes of no activity.

Update the cookies timeout in the **values.yaml** file using the below configuration to set the cookie to expire in 1 hour.

```
api-gateway:
  jwtExpirationSecs: 3600
```

## Create a Session

The path for this request is:

`/api/session?realmName=REALM_NAME`

where the query parameter *realmName* takes as its value the name of a realm to authenticate against.

<Note>
In order to see this object within the [Managed Fusion UI](/managed-fusion/5.9/v90jze/object-explorer), it **must** be associated with an app. To do this, create the object using the `/apps` endpoint.
</Note>

### Input

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| username  *Required* | The username to use in authentication. |
| password  *Required* | The password to use in authentication. |

### Output

The output will include a cookie ID in the HTTP response header. This can be saved to a file and re-used with subsequent REST API requests.

### Examples

*Create a session against an LDAP server and store it in a file named 'cookies':*

**REQUEST**

```bash
curl -c cookies -i -H "content-type:application/json" -X POST -d '{"username":"USERNAME", "password":"PASSWORD"}' https://EXAMPLE_COMPANY.b.lucidworks.cloud/api/session?realmName=REALM_NAME
```

**RESPONSE**

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Set-Cookie: id=840a33d4-b650-49f2-87a4-85412e99b37c;HttpOnly;Path=/api
Content-Length: 0
Server: Jetty(9.1.4.v20140401)
```

<Note>
In this case, we got a response because we set `curl` to include the HTTP in the output. Otherwise, we would not know for sure the session was created.
</Note>

*Use the cookie in another cURL request to see all collections:*

```bash
curl -b cookies https://EXAMPLE_COMPANY.b.lucidworks.cloud/api/collections
```

Roles are groups of permissions that allow access to the UI and the REST APIs. See [Roles](/managed-fusion/5.9/ydvorx/roles) for details.

Security Realms can be configured to use LDAP group membership to assign Roles to users. See the [LDAP configuration for Fusion 5.x](/how-to/dr4445/configure-fusion-5-x-for-ldap) instructions for details.

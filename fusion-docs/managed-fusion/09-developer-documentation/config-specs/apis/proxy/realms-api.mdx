Realms are used to authenticate users across several different user access control systems.

For more information, [view the API specification.](?open-api=true)

There are seven realm types currently supported:

* [Native](/managed-fusion/5.9/sq6b80/security-realms#native), which uses Managed Fusion itself to manage users and passwords.
* [LDAP](/managed-fusion/5.9/sq6b80/security-realms#ldap), which uses an LDAP server as the source of truth for usernames and passwords.
* [Kerberos](/managed-fusion/5.9/sq6b80/security-realms#kerberos), where Managed Fusion can be configured to use Kerberos for authentication.
* [SAML](/managed-fusion/5.9/sq6b80/security-realms#saml), which uses the SAML 2.0 protocol to provide single sign-on.
* [SSO Trusted HTTP](/managed-fusion/5.9/sq6b80/security-realms#sso-trusted-http), which can be configured to return a list of group names, and then map the groups to Managed Fusion roles in the security realm definition.
* [JSON Web Token (JWT)](/managed-fusion/5.9/sq6b80/security-realms#jwt), where you can configure Managed Fusion to use a shared secret key to encrypt the JWT payload.
* [OpenID Connect](/managed-fusion/5.9/sq6b80/security-realms#openid-connect), which is an identity authorization layer that supplements the OAuth 2.0 protocol.
  See [Security Realms](/managed-fusion/5.9/sq6b80/security-realms) for more information about each realm type.

Authenticating users with an LDAP system creates a user record in Managed Fusion, which includes a property for the realm the user belongs to. This Managed Fusion user record is used by administrators to grant users access permissions for the UI or REST API services.

## Create, Update, Delete or List Realms

The path for this request is:

`/api/realm-configs/<id>`

where *`<id>`* is the ID of a realm. The ID is optional for a GET request and omitted from a POST request.

A GET request returns the configured realms. If ID is omitted, all realms will be returned.

A POST request creates a new realm. If the request is successful, a new ID will be generated.

A PUT request updates a realm.

A DELETE request removes the realm.

### Input

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| name  *Required* | The name of the realm. This name will appear on the login screen of the UI, and will appear in user records to identify the realm they belong to. |
| realmType  *Required* | String value for realm type. |
| enabled  *Required* | If **true**, the realm is available for users to use with system authentication. |
| ephemeralUsers | Prevents ephemeral users from being created in ZooKeeper during login. Enabling this property negates `config.autoCreateUsers`. |
| config.autoCreateUsers | Enables/disables the auto-creation of Managed Fusion user accounts after users successfully authenticate for the first time. |
| roleNames | Indicates which roles are dynamically applied to users in the realm. |

#### Additonal Properties per Realm Type

Each realm type requires additional properties for configuration, which should be specified within the `config` object field.

See the following documentation for each realm type:

* **Native.** Native is a preconfigured security realm and Fusion manages all authentication and permissions information directly.
* **LDAP.** [Configure Fusion 5.x for LDAP](/how-to/j73e7i/configure-fusion-5-x-for-ldap)
* **Kerberos.** [Configure Fusion for Kerberos in Unix](/how-to/vp57wz/configure-fusion-for-kerberos-in-unix), [Configure Fusion for Kerberos in Windows](/how-to/cfugam/configure-fusion-for-kerberos-in-windows)
* **SAML.** [Configure Fusion for SAML](/how-to/o2vz4v/configure-fusion-for-saml)
* **SSO Trusted HTTP.** [Configure Managed Fusion for SSO](/how-to/cam88f/configure-fusion-for-sso)
* **JWT.** [Configure Fusion for JWT](/how-to/835/configure-fusion-for-jwt)
* **OpenID Connect.** [Configure OpenID Connect Authentication](/how-to/qqwcqc/configure-open-id-connect-authentication)

### Output

When creating a new realm, the output will include the properties for the realm just created, or an error to indicate a problem with the entry.

For a GET request, the output will include all defined properties of the realm.

For a DELETE or a PUT request, no output will be returned.

Used for template operations.

Use this API for CRUD operations on [templates](/managed-fusion/5.9/5vb3j4/templates#templates) and [zones](/managed-fusion/5.9/5vb3j4/templates#zones). This API also assists with retrieving and rendering templates for particular navigation states.

For more information, [view the API specification.](?open-api=true)

To learn how to use templates in the UI, see [Use Predictive Merchandiser templates](/how-to/5ebds6/use-predictive-merchandiser-templates).

<Note>
**Important**

Use `/api/` before the templating operation, particularly if you are using this API for load testing. For example, use `/api/templating/render/APP_NAME` instead of `/templating/render/APP_NAME`. This ensures the API call does not go through the Managed Fusion UI, which can slow down your response time.

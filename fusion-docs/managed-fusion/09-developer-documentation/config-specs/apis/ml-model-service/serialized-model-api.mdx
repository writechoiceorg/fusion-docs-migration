Use these endpoints to deploy and manage models via Seldon Core.
To fetch predictions, see the [ML Model API](/fusion/5.9/st3vbc/ml-model-api).

For more information, [view the API specification.](?open-api=true)

## Examples

Deploy a model

```bash 
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD -L -X POST 'https://EXAMPLE_COMPANY.b.lucidworks.cloud/api/ai/ml-models?modelId=opennlp&type=seldon' \
-d '@/Users/me/opennlp.bin'
```

Check that the `opennlp` model exists

```bash 
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD https://EXAMPLE_COMPANY.b.lucidworks.cloud/api/ai/ml-models/opennlp
```

The response is `200 OK` if the model is deployed or `404 Not Found` if it is not.

Download the `opennlp` model from Fusion

```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD https://EXAMPLE_COMPANY.b.lucidworks.cloud/api/ai/ml-models/opennlp

```

The response is a binary file.

Delete the `opennlp` model from Fusion

```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD -X DELETE https://EXAMPLE_COMPANY.b.lucidworks.cloud/api/ai/ml-models/opennlp

```

The response is `204 No Content` when the deletion succeeds.

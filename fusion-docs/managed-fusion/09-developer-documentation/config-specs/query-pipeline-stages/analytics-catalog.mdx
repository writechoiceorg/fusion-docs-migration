The Analytics Catalog query pipeline stage lets you define views of data stored in Managed Fusion collections. You can query the objects in the Analytics Catalog using SQL, [Solr Streaming Expressions](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Streaming+Expressions), or regular Solr queries.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

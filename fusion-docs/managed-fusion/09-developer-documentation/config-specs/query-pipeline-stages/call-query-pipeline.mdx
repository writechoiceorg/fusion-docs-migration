The Call Pipeline query stage calls another query pipeline.
You can use this stage to reuse pipeline logic across multiple pipelines.
You can also use it to check for null results, look up related queries, perform fallback queries, and so on.

In the context of a query pipeline, the Call Pipeline stage creates a "subroutine" that pauses the main pipeline while the called pipeline completes its operations.
The called pipeline returns its output to the pipeline that called it, as input for the next pipeline stage.
Note that this is different than Call Pipeline stages in index pipelines, where the called pipeline does *not* return its output to the pipeline that called it.

In the example illustrated below, a Call Pipeline stage invokes a query pipeline that looks up related items and returns those results to the main pipeline as the input to the next pipeline stage:

The main pipeline then continues processing the query.

<Tip>
Use a naming convention for your pipelines that lets you easily differentiate between your main pipelines and the ones you are using as call pipelines.
For example, you can add a suffix like `_cpl` to differentiate your call pipelines from other pipelines.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

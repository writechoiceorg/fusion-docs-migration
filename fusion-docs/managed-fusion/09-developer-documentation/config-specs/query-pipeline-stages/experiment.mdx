The Experiment query pipeline stage is part of Managed Fusionâ€™s [Machine Learning](/managed-fusion/5.9/d0ujzr/machine-learning) framework.

The Machine Learning framework provides tools to evaluate alternative methods of computing and displaying search results. For example, an [experiment](/managed-fusion/5.9/mykfo7/experiments) may consist of a system which has two or more different query pipelines running, and users are randomly served search results using some variant of the system via instrumented pages that capture user response. In such a system, the Experiment query stage selects a variant from a running experiment and inject its properties into the current [Context](/fusion-pipeline-javadocs/5.9/?com/lucidworks/apollo/common/pipeline/Context.html).

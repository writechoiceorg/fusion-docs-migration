The Milvus Query stage performs vectors similarity search in [Milvus](/fusion/5.9/8821/milvus).

<Note>
**Deprecated**

This stage is deprecated in Managed Fusion 5.9.5 and later. It will be removed in a future release.

Replace the Milvus Query Stage with [Seldon](/managed-fusion/5.9/4engao/seldon-vectorize-query-stagee) or [Lucidworks AI vector query stages](/managed-fusion/5.9/uxpzzw/lwai-vectorize-query). These alternatives improve vector search integration and support within Fusionâ€™s evolving AI and machine learning capabilities.
</Note>

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

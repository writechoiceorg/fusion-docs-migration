The Query Fields query pipeline stage defines common Solr query parameters for the [edismax query parser](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/The+Extended+DisMax+Query+Parser). If using a less-than sign (`<`) with DisMax, it must be escaped using a backslash.
An alternative to this stage is the
[Additional Query Parameters stage](/managed-fusion/5.9/8eo8x3/additional-query-parameters-stage).

## Collapsing results

In Managed Fusion 5.9.13 and up, you can configure this stage to collapse search results based on a field, such as `product_id`, to group all variations of each item into a single search result.
This is useful for ecommerce sites where you want to show a single product with multiple SKUs or variations.

Unresolved directive in `<stdin> - include::collapse-enable.asciidoc[]`

For additional collapse options, see the configuration reference below.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

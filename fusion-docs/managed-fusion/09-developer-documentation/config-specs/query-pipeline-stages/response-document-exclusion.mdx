This is a [response rewriting](/managed-fusion/5.9/tsjj9g/response-rewriting) stage that drops all documents that match all of the specified rules (Boolean AND). If some field has multiple values then at least one value must match against the specified pattern. No further processing is done on any matching documents, and they will not be returned in the final set of results. All non-matching documents are passed to the next stage in the pipeline.

This stage must be used *after* the [Solr Query stage](/managed-fusion/5.9/y1y2ol/solr-query-stage) in your pipeline.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

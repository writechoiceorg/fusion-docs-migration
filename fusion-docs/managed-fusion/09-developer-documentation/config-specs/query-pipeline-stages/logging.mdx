The Logging query pipeline stage prints messages to the API log file; the default location is: `https://EXAMPLE_COMPANY.lucidworks.cloud/var/log/api/api.log`.

<Note>
Replace `EXAMPLE_COMPANY` with the name provided by your Lucidworks representative.
</Note>

The verbosity of this message is controlled by the property `detailed`.
If true, then the current Request object will be pretty-printed to the log file.
If false, only the basic information about this stage will be logged.

In a production environment logging stages should be configured with
property `skip` set to `true`, if possible. Use of detailed logging
may impact performance.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

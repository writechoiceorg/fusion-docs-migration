This stage provides query-to-query recommendations.

The stage works in the following way:

1. Perform an exact match of the incoming query to queries stored in the similar queries collection. Return results if a match is found.
2. If **Match non-exact matches** is enabled, the pipeline attempts a normal query and returns the results.
3. If Enable POS tagging is checked, the stage will perform POS tagging on the incoming query and use only the noun parts for the non-exact match.

<Note>
The spaCy model for part-of-speech (POS) tagging no longer ships with fusion. It needs to be deployed as a Seldon container using the [Create Seldon Model deployment job](/managed-fusion/5.9/zgaklc/create-seldon-core-model-deployment).
</Note>

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

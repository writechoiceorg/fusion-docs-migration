The Graph Security Trimming stage restricts query results according to the user ID as an alternative to [Security Trimming Stage](/managed-fusion/5.9/hnw5gy/security-trimming-stage). Whereas the Security Trimming stage has one Solr filter query per data source, Graph Security Trimming uses a single filter query for all data sources.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

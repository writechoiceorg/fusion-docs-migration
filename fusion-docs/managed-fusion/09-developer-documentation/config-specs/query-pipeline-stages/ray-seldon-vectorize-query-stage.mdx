The Ray/Seldon Vectorize Query stage generates a vector based on the current query string (q parameter). In Managed Fusion 5.9.11 and earlier, this stage is called Seldon Vectorize Query.

<Note>
This feature is only available in Managed Fusion 5.9.x for versions 5.9.6+.
</Note>

For more information on setting up vector search with Ray or Seldon, see [Configure Ray/Seldon vector search](/how-to/f2t34r/configure-ray-seldon-vector-search).

<Note>
**Important**

This query stage must be placed *before* the **[Solr Query stage](/managed-fusion/5.9/y1y2ol/solr-query-stage)**.
</Note>

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

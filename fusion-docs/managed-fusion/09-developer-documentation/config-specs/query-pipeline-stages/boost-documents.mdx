The Boost Documents query pipeline stage adds boosting parameters to matched documents based on user-defined rules. Boosts are defined with a term value to boost and the boost factor to add. The boosting parameters are added to the `bq` Solr query parameter.

The Boost Documents rule consists of the following elements:

* `field`. The document field to filter on.
* `keywords`. The words, phrases, or regex used as the filter.
* `mode`. Filtering logic applied to keywords, one of:

  + `exact`. The keyword and the query must match exactly. This is case-sensitive.
  + `phrase`. The phrase matching on the items in the keywords list.
  + `regex`. Treat items in the keywords list as a regex.
  + `match`. Must match every item in the keyword list, but does not require phrase matching.
* `boosts`. Consists of a list of pairs.

  + `value`. One or more terms used for boosting.
  + `boost`. The numeric boost value. Default `100`.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

## Boost calculation

Numbers entered into boosts are *multiplied* with the score.

As a result of multiplication:

* Negative boosts are not possible. You must use fractional values to deprioritize the score. For example, a boost value of 0.5 decreases the score by half.
* Do not use values such as 100. If those values are entered, document scores are boosted to an unrealistically high level.
* Managed Fusion generates an error when a query is executed on a pipeline that uses negative boost values.

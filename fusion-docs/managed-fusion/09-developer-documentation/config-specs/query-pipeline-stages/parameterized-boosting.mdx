The Parameterized Boosting query pipeline stage reads the `boostValues` (in `List<DocumentResult>` format) from the context variable (added by a [Rollup Aggregation stage](/managed-fusion/5.9/mz3o72/rollup-aggregation) or a [JavaScript stage](/managed-fusion/5.9/56khq2/java-script-stage)), and adds boosts to the main query using `bq` or `boost` based on the stage configuration. The weights for the boost values can also be scaled.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

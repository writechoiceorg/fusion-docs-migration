This stage uses the content of the current document to query for similar documents, using Solrâ€™s MoreLikeThis component.

This stage provides content-based recommendations. For collaborative recommendations, use the [Recommend Items for Item stage](/managed-fusion/5.9/hq339y/recommend-items-for-item-stage).

See [Methods for recommendations and Boosting](/managed-fusion/5.9/l0emoh/methods) for more information.

## Tips

* The incoming query must include an `id` field in order to get recommendations from this stage. The stage returns documents similar to the one specified by this field.
* Since these secondary queries tend to be large, this stage can impact search performance. You can improve performance by first [clustering your documents](/managed-fusion/5.9/x7s5ub/document-clustering-jobs), then configuring this stage to query a specific document cluster instead of all documents.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

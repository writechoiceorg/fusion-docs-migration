The Milvus Response Update stage updates response documents with vectors similarity and ensemble scores (see [Milvus documentation](/fusion/5.9/8821/milvus)). It should be used after the [Milvus Ensemble Query stage](/managed-fusion/5.9/w4qysk/milvus-ensemble-query-stage) and after the [Solr Query stage](/managed-fusion/5.9/y1y2ol/solr-query-stage).

<Note>

**Deprecated**

This stage is deprecated in Managed Fusion 5.9.5 and later. It will be removed in a future release.

Replace the Milvus Response Update Query Stage with [Seldon](/managed-fusion/5.9/4engao/seldon-vectorize-query-stagee) or [Lucidworks AI vector query stages](/managed-fusion/5.9/uxpzzw/lwai-vectorize-query). These alternatives improve vector search integration and support within Fusionâ€™s evolving AI and machine learning capabilities.
</Note>

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

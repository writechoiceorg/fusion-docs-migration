Most rules operate on the request, but some [rule types](/managed-fusion/5.9/tw7rlx/query-rewriting#types), such as banner rules or redirect rules, do their work when the response comes back. The Modify Response with Rules stage applies those rules to the response. For example, a banner rule can add a banner URL to the response before returning it to the client.

See [Rules](/managed-fusion/5.9/tw7rlx/query-rewriting) for additional details about how to configure this set of features.

**TIPS**:

* The [Apply Rules](/managed-fusion/5.9/yx85m4/apply-rules-stage) stage must be enabled as a prerequisite for this stage.
* This stage has no configuration keys; simply enable or disable the stage.
* Although this stage is available without a Managed Fusion license, it is only effective after creating [rules](/managed-fusion/5.9/tw7rlx/query-rewriting) in Managed Fusion.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

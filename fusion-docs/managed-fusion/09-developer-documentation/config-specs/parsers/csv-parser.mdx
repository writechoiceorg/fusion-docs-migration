This parser breaks down incoming CSV files into the most efficient components for Managed Fusion to index.
It produces one new document per row from the CSV input, excluding comment rows and header rows.

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

The Fallback parser stage is useful for processing data that Managed Fusion does not have a specified parsing process for. Fallback does not technically parse data, since it does not know what to do with it, it simply copies the raw bytes into a Solr document. If your Managed Fusion parser stage configuration encounters data it does not know how to parse, such as someone’s proprietary data file format, it will copy it as-is, whereas if it encounters recognizable data in more common file types, such as PDFs, Managed Fusion will parse the text and metadata using Tika.

The Fallback parser acts as the final stage that attempts to parse any documents that haven’t been parsed already. More commonly, the parser selects a stage specifically built to handle the data and runs that stage.

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

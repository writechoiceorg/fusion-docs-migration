<Note>
**Important**
This stage is deprecated in Fusion 5.8.x and removed in Fusion 5.9.12.
Use the [Apache Tika Container parser](/managed-fusion/5.9/fi9zfy/apache-tika-container) instead.
</Note>

Apache Tika Server is a versatile parser that supports parsing many document formats.

This stage is not compatible with asynchronous Tika parsing.

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

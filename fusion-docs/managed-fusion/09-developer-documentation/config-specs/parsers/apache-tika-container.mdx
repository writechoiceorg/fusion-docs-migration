Apache Tika Container is a versatile parser that supports many types of unstructured document formats, such as HTML, PDF, Microsoft Office, OpenOffice, RTF, audio, video, images, and more. A complete list of supported formats is available at [Apache Tika](http://tika.apache.org/).

See [Use Tika Asynchronous Parsing](/how-to/5h70cn/use-tika-asynchronous-parsing) for detailed steps to set up asynchronous parsing.

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

While connectors are integral to Managed Fusion, they operate on independent development, release, and update cycles.

For the most up-to-date information on connector compatibility and configuration, refer to [Connectors Configuration Reference](/fusion-connectors/5.8/63/configuration-reference) in the connectors documentation. Be sure to pay close attention to any in-text guidance specific to Managed Fusion.

The Gazetteer Lookup Extraction index stage (called the Gazetteer Lookup Extractor stage in versions earlier than 3.0) uses predefined lists of words and phrases to process specified text fields in a document.
A gazetteer is a set of lookup lists over names of people, places, or things.
These lookup lists are used to find occurrences of these names in text.
The matched items are saved into separate fields on the document for downstream processing.

## Gazetteers and OpenNLP Tools

The following video shows how to configure a Gazetteer Lookup Extraction stage in combination with OpenNLP:

## Uploading Lookup Lists to Managed Fusion Blob Store

Managed Fusion includes a number of lookup lists in the directory at `https://EXAMPLE_COMPANY.lucidworks.cloud/data/nlp/gazetteer`.
To use the supplied lists or a list of your own data, each must list be uploaded to Managed Fusion
using the [Blob Store API](/managed-fusion/5.9/6q1cvp/blob-store-api)
in order to make the list contents available to the Gazetteer Lookup Extraction stage.

For example, to identify color names, you would first compile a list of color terms, one entry per line in a text file with suffix `.lst` and then
upload that file using the Managed Fusion REST API endpoint `api/blobs/<listfilename>`, as per the following example which
uses the `curl` command-line utility, where 'admin' is the name of a user with admin privileges, and 'pass' is that userâ€™s password:

```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD -X PUT --data-binary @data/nlp/gazetteer/colors.lst -H 'Content-type: text/plain' http://EXAMPLE_COMPANY.lucidworks.cloud/api/blobs/colors.lst
```

<Note>
Replace `EXAMPLE_COMPANY` with the name provided by your Lucidworks representative.

## Name Lookup Example

*Define a lookup-extractor to identify mentions of certain celebrities in text field `description_t`:*

```json
{
  "type" : "lookup-extractor",
  "id" : "peopleLookup",
  "rules" : [ {
    "source" : [ "description_t" ],
    "target" : "celebrities_ss",
    "entityTypes" : [ {
      "name" : "person_female",
      "definitions" : [ "person_female.lst" ]
    } ],
    "additionalEntities" : [ {
      "name" : "players",
      "definitions" : [ "sharapova", "murray" ]
    }, {
      "name" : "actors",
      "definitions" : [ "pitt", "jolie" ]
    } ],
    "caseSensitive" : false
  } ],
  "skip" : false
}
```

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

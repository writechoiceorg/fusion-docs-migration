The Managed Fusion machine learning indexing stage uses a trained machine learning model to analyze a field or fields of a [PipelineDocument](/fusion-pipeline-javadocs/5.9/?com/lucidworks/apollo/common/pipeline/PipelineDocument.html) and stores the results of analysis in a new field of either the PipelineDocument or [Context](/fusion-pipeline-javadocs/5.9/?com/lucidworks/apollo/common/pipeline/Context.html) object.

In order to use the Machine Learning Stage, you must train a machine learning model. For more information on machine learning in Managed Fusion, see:

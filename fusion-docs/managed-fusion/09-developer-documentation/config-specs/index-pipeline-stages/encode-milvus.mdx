The Encode into Milvus index stage invokes a machine learning model to encode a field and store it into [Milvus](/fusion/5.9/8821/milvus).

## Troubleshooting

### Update a Milvus collection

Update and delete semantics are not supported on individual items in a Milvus collection. We recommend that you use a blue/green set of collections: reindex to apply updates to an empty Milvus collection, then swap between collections to apply the updates.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

The Exclusion Filter index stage is used to remove fields or documents that match items in a pre-defined exclusion list.

There are two ways to supply an exclusion list:

* Upload a file containing a newline-separated list, using the [Blob Store](/managed-fusion/5.9/6q1cvp/blob-store-api). When configuring the index stage, reference the list by its blob name in the `location` property (**Exclusion List URI** in the Managed Fusion UI).
* When configuring the index stage, enter an array of values for exclusion in the `excludeValues` property (**Exclusion List** in the Managed Fusion UI).

The Exclusion Filter stage can be configured using one or both of these methods; Managed Fusion combines them into one list. If `regexPattern` is configured, the pattern is applied to the field before the result is compared to the combined list.

By default, any matching *field* is excluded from indexing. To exclude the whole document, set `skipDocument` to "true" (**Skip Document** in the Managed Fusion UI).

## Uploading an exclusion list

Before you can configure the `location` property, you must upload one or more exclusion lists to Managed Fusion using the [Blob Store API](/managed-fusion/5.9/6q1cvp/blob-store-api).

Managed Fusion comes with an example exclusion list at `https://EXAMPLE_COMPANY.lucidworks.cloud/data/nlp/excludes/excludes.txt`. Here is an example of how to upload this file using `curl`, where `USERNAME:PASSWORD` are the credentials for an admin-level user:

```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD -X PUT --data-binary @data/nlp/excludes/excludes.txt -H 'Content-type: text/plain' http://EXAMPLE_COMPANY.lucidworks.cloud/api/blobs/excludes.txt
```

<Note>
Replace `EXAMPLE_COMPANY` with the name provided by your Lucidworks representative.

## Example

*Use an exclusion list for entities found in the author field:*

```json
{
    "type" : "exclusion-filter",
    "id" : "iw",
    "filters" : [ {
      "sourceField" : "author_s",
      "location" : "excludes.txt",
      "caseSensitive" : false
    } ],
    "skip" : false
  } ]
}
```

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

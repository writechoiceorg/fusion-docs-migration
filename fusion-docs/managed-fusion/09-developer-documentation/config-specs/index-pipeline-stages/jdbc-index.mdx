The JDBC Index Stage is used to connect to a database, lookup one or more values, and then inject them into the context.
The properties for setting stage are identical to the [JDBC Query Stage](/managed-fusion/5.9/a8d5qj/jdbc-lookup-stage), except for the "rows" property, which defaults to **-1** for the index stage (which returns all rows in the database), and defaults to **10** returned rows for the query stage.

<Note>
You must first [upload the JDBC driver to Managed Fusion](/how-to/ennwa5/upload-a-jdbc-driver-to-managed-fusion).
</Note>

## Example

An example of a JDBC Index Stage setup

*Upload stage config via POST to Managed Fusion REST API endpoint `api/index-stages/instances`*

```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id": "jdbc-index-test","type":"jdbc-index-lookup","driver":"postgresql-9.3-1101-jdbc4.jar","connection":"jdbc:postgresql:database","username":"user","password":"password1","preparedStatement":"select ID as id from DATABASE;"}' http://EXAMPLE_COMPANY.lucidworks.cloud/api/index-stages/instances
```

<Note>
Replace `EXAMPLE_COMPANY` with the name provided by your Lucidworks representative.
</Note>

*Response*

```json
{
  "type" : "jdbc-index-lookup",
  "id" : "jdbc-index-test",
  "driver" : "postgresql-9.3-1101-jdbc4.jar",
  "connection" : "jdbc:postgresql:database",
  "username" : "user",
  "password" : "password1",
  "preparedStatement" : "select ID as id from DATABASE;",
  "fetchSize" : -1,
  "join" : true,
  "rows" : -1,
  "skip" : false,
  "label" : "jdbc-index-lookup",
  "type" : "jdbc-index-lookup"
}

```

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

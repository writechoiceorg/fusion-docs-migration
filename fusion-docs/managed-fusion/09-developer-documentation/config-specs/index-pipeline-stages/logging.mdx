The Logging Index stage prints messages to the Connectors log file. The default location is: `https://EXAMPLE_COMPANY.lucidworks.cloud/var/log/api/fusion-indexing.log`.

<Note>
Replace `EXAMPLE_COMPANY` with the name provided by your Lucidworks representative.
</Note>

The verbosity of this message is controlled by the property `detailed`.
When detailed logging is true the current PipelineDocument object is pretty-printed to the Connectors log file.

In a production environment logging stages should be configured with
property `skip` set to `true`, if possible. Use of detailed logging
may impact performance.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

The Ray/Seldon Vectorize Field stage invokes a machine learning model to encode a string field to a vector representation. In Managed Fusion 5.9.11 and earlier, this stage is called Seldon Vectorize Field.

<Note>

This feature is only available in Managed Fusion 5.9.x for versions 5.9.6+.

</Note>

For more information on setting up vector search with Ray or Seldon, see [Configure Ray/Seldon vector search](/how-to/f2t34r/configure-ray-seldon-vector-search).

<Note>
**Important**

This index stage must be placed *before* the **[Solr Indexer stage](/fusion/5.9/227/solr-indexer-stage)**.

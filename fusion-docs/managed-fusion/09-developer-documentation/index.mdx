This section of the documentation contains technical reference materials for software developers who want to configure and customize Managed Fusion.
Refer to this reference documentation to help manage your Managed Fusion deployment and develop front-end search applications.
To develop and integrate with Managed Fusion, you should have a working knowledge of Java, Solr, and RESTful architecture.
When developing front-end applications, familiarity with Javascript is also helpful.

<Note>
Typically, Managed Fusion clients do not have developer access in production environments. Some API endpoints require certain roles and permissions that you may not have access to, or may only access on lower environments. To learn more, see [roles and permissions](/managed-fusion/5.9/zm43ol/environments#roles-and-environments).
</Note>

## Configuration specifications

Refer to the [Configuration specifications](/managed-fusion/5.9/w7c3hp/configuration-specifications) for detailed reference documentation related to REST APIs, parsers, pipeline stages, and jobs.
Use [Managed Fusion REST APIs](/managed-fusion/5.9/t51gkk/ap-is) to create custom integrations and applications.
Automate administrative tasks, manage your Fusion instance, deploy and run machine learning models, and more.

## Front-end development

Learn about [front-end development](/fusion/5.9/177/front-end-development) with Fusion and how to configure common search application features, like [autocomplete](/managed-fusion/5.9/k9eu8d/autocomplete).
This section also contains [examples](/managed-fusion/5.9/ewzmy0/rest-api-examples) of typical API and query calls when configuring front-end applications.

## Javadocs

[Javadocs](/managed-fusion/5.9/b153xz/javadocs) provide descriptions of the classes and methods used in Managed Fusion that you can use when developing front-end search applications.

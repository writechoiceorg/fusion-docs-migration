The Managed Fusion UI gives you easy access to all Managed Fusion features.

The UI service utilizes the API service, so each UI feature has an API equivalent. For programmatic access to the features you see in the UI, see the [API Reference Guide](/managed-fusion/5.9/t51gkk/ap-is).

The first time you log in:

Managed Fusion opens the [Quickstart](/how-to/w1eu0z/quickstart), to give you a demonstration of Managed Fusion’s most basic features. You can click **Exit the Quickstart** to close it and go to the Managed Fusion launcher.

You can open the Quickstart at any time by navigating to the Managed Fusion launcher and clicking **New here? Get started…​**.

The brief tour below shows you how to find your way around the interface. For a more detailed tour, try the [Get Started](how-to/get-started-mf/lrrfgb/getting-started-with-managed-fusion) tutorial.

## A brief tour

* The *launcher* is where you can view all apps in your Managed Fusion environment and create new ones.
* The *Managed Fusion workspace* is where you configure how an app ingests, indexes, queries, and analyzes data.

### The Managed Fusion launcher

When you log in to Managed Fusion, the first page is the Managed Fusion launcher. This is where you create and launch apps:

<Frame>![Launcher](/assets/images/5.6/launcher-1-56.png)</Frame>

To return to the Managed Fusion workspace, hover over <InlineImage src="/assets/images/5.6/workspace-menu-apps-56.png"/>, and then click **Return to launcher**.

See details about [Managed Fusion apps](/managed-fusion/5.9/hnym6k/managed-fusion-apps).

### The Managed Fusion workspace

You can reach the Managed Fusion workspace by clicking on any app in the launcher. When you enter the Managed Fusion workspace, you find all the tools you need to configure the selected app:

* On the left side are the [app tool menus](#app-tool-menus), where you can find tools for working with your app.
* [System-wide tools](#system-wide-tools) are at the top of the UI. With the exception of the **Collections** tool, which allows you to switch between collections for your app, these tools do not concern your app specifically.

#### App tool menus

<Frame>![alt](/assets/images/5.6/ui-tour-part-1-56.png)</Frame>

On the left side of the screen are six menus where you can find tools for working with your app:

1. <InlineImage src="/assets/images/5.6/workspace-menu-indexing-56.png"/> **Indexing** (getting data in)

   The [Index Workbench](/managed-fusion/5.9/g4oud0/index-workbench) is the primary tool for getting data into your app through the Managed Fusion UI. It provides an all-in-one view of the components of a datasource. You can also access those components individually through this menu.
2. <InlineImage src="/assets/images/5.6/workspace-menu-querying-56.png"/> **Querying** (getting data out)

   For getting data out, the [Query Workbench](/managed-fusion/5.9/ukxc4p/query-workbench) is the main tool. It shows you a live preview of search results while you configure and fine tune your query pipelines.

   See also [Query data](/managed-fusion/5.9/s3j1mi/query-data).
3. <InlineImage src="/assets/images/5.6/workspace-menu-collections-56.png"/> **Collections**

   Manage your data collections and configure their features.

   See also [Collection Management](/managed-fusion/5.9/n8oj99/collections).
4. <InlineImage src="/assets/images/5.6/relevance-icon-56.png"/> **Relevance**

   Add or edit rules, recommendations, and signals.
5. <InlineImage src="/assets/images/5.6/analytics-icon-56.png"/> **Analytics Hub**

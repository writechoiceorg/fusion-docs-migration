*Managed Fusion apps* provide tailored search functionality to specific groups of users.

An app is a named set of linked *objects*, including collections, datasources, index and query pipelines, index and query profiles, parsers, and more.
You can define security on a per-app basis using [roles](/managed-fusion/5.9/ydvorx/roles) and
[security realms](/managed-fusion/5.9/sq6b80/security-realms).

Generally, you will create multiple apps for different purposes. You can view all of your apps in the launcher when you log in to the Managed Fusion UI:

To enter the Managed Fusion workspace for any app, click the app name.

In the Managed Fusion workspace, you can hover over <InlineImage src="/assets/images/5.6/workspace-menu-apps-56.png"/> to switch to another app, create a new app, or return to the launcher:

Machine learning empowers your search by automatically boosting relevant items, providing solutions for cold start, and preventing zero results.
Managed Fusion includes several built-in machine learning features:

* [Smart Answers](/managed-fusion/5.9/mwqude/smart-answers) provides pre-trained cold start language models that leverages vector search, improving relevancy.
* [Never Null](/managed-fusion/5.9/nscvv0/never-null) prevents customers from returning zero search results, even if they enter misspelled queries or search for items that donâ€™t exist in the product catalog.
* [Sentiment Analysis and Prediction](/managed-fusion/5.9/rn3h18/sentiment-analysis-and-prediction) provides pre-trained models that help you interpret subjective and emotional aspects of queries.

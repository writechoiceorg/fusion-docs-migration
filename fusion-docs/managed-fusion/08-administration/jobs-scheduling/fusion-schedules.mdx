A *schedule* defines when Managed Fusion will perform a job.

You can schedule a job using `cron` notation, ISO-8601 interval definitions, or triggers that depend on the results of other jobs.

You can also run jobs on demand.

The [Jobs API](/managed-fusion/5.9/lggfzz/jobs-api) lets you view jobs and their run histories, configure their schedules, and control them directly.

## The Scheduler

The Scheduler, available in the Managed Fusion workspace at **System** > **Scheduler**, provides an interface for scheduling jobs.

You cannot create jobs in the Scheduler. To create new jobs, use the [Jobs manager](/managed-fusion/5.9/mz6jhc/jobs-and-scheduling#jobs-manager) or the REST API for each [job type](/managed-fusion/5.9/mz6jhc/jobs-and-scheduling#job-types).

A *job* is a runnable Managed Fusion object that performs a specific activity, such as datasource jobs and Spark jobs. Examples of the activities include:

* Aggregating signal data
* Training a shallow neural model and projecting each document onto the resulting vector embedding space
* Loading data into a data source

## Job types

Each job type is a type of Managed Fusion object that you can run or schedule to be run.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| `datasource` | A job to ingest data according to the specified datasource configuration, such as `datasource:movie-db`. Datasources are created using the [Connector Datasources API](/managed-fusion/5.9/kwpz3n/connector-datasources-api) or the Managed Fusion UI.  See [Datasource Jobs](/managed-fusion/5.9/4xe02f/datasource-jobs). |
| `spark` | A Spark job to process data, such as `spark:dailyMetricsRollup-counters`. Spark jobs are created using the [Spark Jobs API](/managed-fusion/5.9/bwbw71/spark-jobs-api) or the Managed Fusion UI.  See [Spark Jobs](/managed-fusion/5.9/2ma2g9/spark-jobs). |

## The Jobs manager

The Jobs manager, available in the Managed Fusion workspace at **Collections** > **Jobs**, provides a simple interface for viewing and scheduling jobs. You can also create tasks and Spark jobs here.

<Note>
You cannot create, run, or schedule datasource jobs in the Jobs manager. You must create them on the Datasources page, in the Index Workbench, or in the Quickstart. To run a datasource job, use the [scheduler](/managed-fusion/5.9/sd81yi/fusion-schedules#the-scheduler).

Managed Fusion clients have access to multiple environments. The number and type of environments depends on your setup and agreement. Usually, you have one production environment and multiple non-production environments, which you can use to try out new features, test configurations, and stage changes before pushing them into production.

## Types of environments

There are five types of enviroments that Lucidworks supports. A typical Managed Fusion client has access to two (development and production) or three (development, stage, and production) environments.

### Production

This is the environment where production workloads are served. Any changes made are publicly available to end users.

### Performance

This environment is used for performing load tests against production-equivalent configurations.

### Stage

This environment is where you can test development changes in a more scalable environment. This is also the environment where work is staged for promotion to the production environment.

### Quality Assurance

Smaller than stage, this environment is intended for running automated tests.

### Development

Also known as the sandbox or POC (proof of concept) environment, this is where you can perform application and system development tasks, such as designing, programming, and debugging.

## Roles and environments

The [roles](/managed-fusion/5.9/ydvorx/roles) Managed Fusion clients have depend on the type of environment.

| Environment | Roles |

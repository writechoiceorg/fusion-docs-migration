The Items for Query recommender is the primary algorithm that supports recommendations on the search results page.

Items-for-query recommendations are based on how other users interacted with search results from the same query. This is one type of [collaborative recommendation](/managed-fusion/5.9/l0emoh/methods#content-based-vs-collaborative).

For example, if users have searched for "titanic" in the past and many of them clicked on the search result for the DVD of the movie *Titanic* (as opposed to books or memorabilia), then this method boosts the DVD item on subsequent searches for "titanic".

Below is an example of items-for-query recommendations based on a search for "madonna":

To use this type of boosting, signals must be enabled but recommendations need not be.

## Job configuration

The items-for-query recommendations are implemented as a [Query-to-Query Session-Based Similarity](/managed-fusion/5.9/6e6pkd/query-to-query-session-based-similarity-jobs-experimental) job.

## Query pipeline configuration

The [Boost with Signals](/managed-fusion/5.9/ihes2t/boost-with-signals-stage) query stage is part of the default query pipeline, so usually you do not need to add it. It takes its input from the aggregated signals collection (`COLLECTION_NAME_signals_aggr`) at query time.

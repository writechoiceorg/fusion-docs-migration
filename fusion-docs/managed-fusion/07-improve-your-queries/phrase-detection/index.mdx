Phrase detection identifies phrases in your signals so that results with matching phrases can be boosted. This helps compensate for queries where phrases are not distinguished with quotation marks. For example, the query `ipad case` is rewritten as `“ipad case”~10^2`, meaning if `ipad` and `case` appear **within 10** terms (whitespace-delimited tokens) of each other, then boost the result by a factor of **2**.

Phrases are applied in the [Text Tagger stage](/managed-fusion/5.9/74ygo4/text-tagger-stage) of the query pipeline.

Use a Remove Words query rewrite to remove particular phrases from queries. Unlike other rewrites, Remove Words rules are entered manually and arenâ€™t generated by a job.

You can create a Remove Words query rewrite to remove words from a query. This query rewrite is helpful when a word in the search query does not add value to the search results.

For example, you can rewrite a search query for `case study examples` to remove `examples` and then display results for `case study`.

1. From the list of query rewrite options, select Remove Words. A form appears:

2. This form contains the following fields:

| Parameter | Description | Example Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phrase to remove | The words to remove from the trigger phrase. | `examples` |
| Trigger phrases | The query that prompts the removal of the phrase. The trigger phrase is not necessarily a complete query. If the query contains the trigger phrase, then Fusion removes the phrase in the Phrase to Remove field. | `case study examples` |

1. Enter a phrase to remove and a trigger phrase. Note that the phrase to remove is auto-populated with the query.
2. Click **Save**.

The search is re-run, and a Search box information panel drops down to show that the new query rewrite has fired:

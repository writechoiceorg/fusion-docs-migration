Business rule actions define what actions are taken when a rule fires.

<Note>
Some rule actions are only available to specific version of Managed Fusion.
</Note>

## Configuration options

### Banner

The Banner action returns an image outside of the search results that can be displayed in the frontend.

For example, an e-commerce website may display a banner to promote a sale or new product release.

| Required | Parameter | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | **Banner URL** | The URL of the desired banner image. | `https://example-site.com/assets/promotion.png` |
|  | **Banner zone** | An arbitrary value used by the frontend, generally to instruct the search application where to place the banner image. | `TOP` |

### Block list

The Block List action blocks the associated values from appearing in the search results.

For example, a workplace may block documents that the user does not have permission to view.

| Required | Parameter | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | **Field name** | The name of the field that the rule action applies to. The documents in the datasource determine what fields are available. | `title` |
| ✅ | **Field values** | The values of the field that the rule action applies to. The field determines what field values are available. | `Voyager Jacket` |

### Boost attributes

The Boost Attributes action boosts documents with specific attributes in a search. Boosts can be additive or multiplicative.

For example, an e-commerce website may boost the laptop manufacturer’s name if the search query contains a manufacturer.

| Required | Parameter | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | **Boost param** | * `bq`. An additive boost that is added to the main query’s score. * `boost`. A multiplicative boost based on document scores. This boost increases or decreases the score by a relative amount. | `boost` |
| ✅ | **Boost query** | The query that the boost will apply to. | `bq`: `category_s:"Small Business"^5`  `boost`: `category_s:"Small Business"` |

### Boost list

The Boost List action boosts documents with a large multiplicative boost so the documents appear at the top of the results. Larger boosts can override this action.

For example, an e-commerce website may boost new or seasonal items.

| Required | Parameter | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | **Field name** | The name of the field that the rule action applies to. The documents in the datasource determine what fields are available. | `title` |
| ✅ | **Field values** | The values of the field that the rule action applies to. The field determines what field values are available. | `Voyager Jacket` |

### Bury list

The Bury List action buries documents with the selected values. This action minimizes certain documents without blocking them.

For example, a workplace may bury out-of-date documents.

| Required | Parameter | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | **Field name** | The name of the field that the rule action applies to. The documents in the datasource determine what fields are available. | `title` |
| ✅ | **Field values** | The values of the field that the rule action applies to. The field determines what field values are available. | `Voyager Jacket` |

### Filter list

The Filter List action applies [filter queries](https://solr.apache.org/guide/common-query-parameters.html) (`fq`) to the query and changes the results so a pre-selected set of content displays.

For example, an e-commerce website may display only movies rated G or PG when a user searches for children’s movies.

| Required | Parameter | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | **Field name** | The name of the field that the rule action applies to. The documents in the datasource determine what fields are available. | `title` |
| ✅ | **Field values** | The values of the field that the rule action applies to. The field determines what field values are available. | `Voyager Jacket` |

### Ingroup actions

Ingroup actions perform a specific action within a [product group](/managed-fusion/5.9/j802t6/results-and-page-concepts#product-grouping). You can boost, bury, or pin specific items within a group.

Ingroup actions require a grouping field to perform the action within.

The Ingroup Boost List action boosts an item within a product group. This action does not boost the product group.

| Required | Parameter | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | **Field name** | The name of the field that the rule action applies to. The documents in the datasource determine what fields are available. | `title` |
| ✅ | **Field values** | The values of the field that the rule action applies to. The field determines what field values are available. | `Voyager Jacket` |
| ✅ | **Grouping field** | The name of the group field that the rule action applies to. This group field *must* have a `group-field` parameter or the rule does not apply. | `color_group_name` |

#### Ingroup bury list

The Ingroup Bury List action buries an item within a product group. This action does not bury the product group.

| Required | Parameter | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | **Field name** | The name of the field that the rule action applies to. The documents in the datasource determine what fields are available. | `title` |
| ✅ | **Field values** | The values of the field that the rule action applies to. The field determines what field values are available. | `Voyager Jacket` |
| ✅ | **Grouping field** | The name of the group field that the rule action applies to. This group field *must* have a `group-field` parameter or the rule does not apply. | `color_group_name` |

#### Ingroup pinned

The Ingroup Pinned action sticks a document to a specific location within a product group. This ensures that users view a result in a specified place. This action does not pin the product group.

| Required | Parameter | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | **Field name** | The name of the field that the rule action applies to. The documents in the datasource determine what fields are available. | `title` |
| ✅ | **Field values** | The values of the field that the rule action applies to. The field determines what field values are available. | `Voyager Jacket` |
| ✅ | **Grouping field** | The name of the group field that the rule action applies to. This group field *must* have a `group-field` parameter or the rule does not apply. | `color_group_name` |
| ✅ | **Pin within a specific group value** | The values of the grouping field that the rule action applies to. The field determines what field values are available. Only a single group value is supported. | `red` |
| ✅ | **Pinned documents** | The individual documents that the rule action applies to. | `Summit Pants (red)` |

### Pinned

The Pinned action sticks a document to a specific location within the search results. This ensures that users view a result in a specified place.

For example, a workplace may pin documents answering frequently asked questions.

| Required | Parameter | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | **Field name** | The name of the field that the rule action applies to. The documents in the datasource determine what fields are available. | `id` |

The field determines what field values are available.<br/>- Position: Position within the results where the document is pinned, with `1` being the 1st result. Each position is available to only a single document. | Value: `1000026`  Position: `4` |

### Redirect

The Redirect action displays a message at the top of the search results that the frontend can utilize to redirect a user to a specific URL. This action guides users to the desired URL when the search query isn’t included in the collection.

For example, a workplace may create a redirect action that displays a link to the internal help desk when an employee searches for "computer broken".

| Required | Parameter | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| ✅ | **Field value** | The response value that is included in the results response. | `AD_CODE_99` |

### Set facets

The Set Facets action customizes the facets returned in the query response. These facets are different from the facets set in the Query Workbench.

For example, an e-commerce website may display different facets on the homepage, the primary search page, and category pages.

</table>

### Set Params

The Set Params action sets a [parameter name and value](https://solr.apache.org/guide/common-query-parameters.html) to a search query.

For example, a workplace may use the name and value to display only specific filetypes in the results.

| Required | Parameter | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | **Parameter name** | The name of the [query parameter](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/QueryParametersIndex). | `fl` |
| ✅ | **Parameter value** | The value of the query parameter. | `discountAmount` |
| ✅ | **Update policy** | The manner in which the parameter affects the results response: <br/>* `append`. Add the parameter to the default parameters in the results response.<br/>* `default`. Add the parameter to the default parameters in the results response if it is not already included in the request or the default specification in the Solr config file solrconfig.xml.<br/>* `remove`. Remove the parameter from the results response.<br/>* `replace`. Replace the default parameter in the results response. | `append` |

### JSON Blob

The JSON Blob action returns an [arbitrary JSON blob](/managed-fusion/5.9/03vd0y/business-rules#faq) to your frontend when a business rule fires. The JSON blob displays outside of the search results.

| Required | Parameter | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | **Blob Type** | An arbitrary value used by the frontend, generally to indicate what kind of data the JSON blob contains. | `default` |
| ✅ | **JSON Blob** | An arbitrary JSON value used by the frontend. When the rule is triggered, the JSON is sent with the results response. This behaves similarly to the **Banner** rule, given that it returns the JSON object *outside* of the search results. | `{"parameter1":"value", "parameter2":["value_a", "value_b"]}` |

## Additional configuration options

* **Set response values.** Combine **Response Value** rules with other rules for purposes as [described above](#response-value).
* **Use Query Elevation Component (QEC).** Apply the rule action to configure the top results regardless of the document’s score. However, enabling QEC does not boost the document’s score. The QEC only supports elevation through the `id` field. If QEC is enabled but is not configured correctly in Solr, the rule does not fire.

  To use the Query Elevation Component, you must first [configure your Solr cluster](/how-to/8867/use-the-query-elevation-component). Note that query elevation *does not boost scores*.

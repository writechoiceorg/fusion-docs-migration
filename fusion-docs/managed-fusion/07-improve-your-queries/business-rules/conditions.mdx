Conditions, or triggers, define the environment necessary for the rule action to fire. Any combination of conditions (date, field value, query, and query profile) can be defined for a rule.

Query profile triggers can be tested in the [Query Workbench](/managed-fusion/5.9/yggpzg/query-workbench) or with the [Query Pipelines API](/managed-fusion/5.9/hd4an7/query-pipelines-api) by setting `queryProfileID` parameter on the request.

## Configuration options

### Condition types

#### Dates

| Required | Parameter | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | **Dates** | The date and time range for the rule. | `01/01/2021 12:00 to 01/31/2021 12:00` |

#### Field value

| Required | Parameter | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | **Filters** | The filters that determine whether the rule fires:  * Field name. The name of the field that the rule action applies to. The documents in the datasource determine what fields are available. * Field value. The values of the field that the rule action applies to. The field determines what field values are available. | Field name: `color_group_name`  Field value: `red` |

#### Query

| Required | **Parameter** | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | **Match query using** | Method used for query matching. Choose from the following:  * `keywords`. The query must match the keywords of the **Search terms** value exactly. For example, if the **Search terms** value is `red pants`, only that value triggers the rule. The rule is not triggered if the value is `red`, `pants`, or `small red pants`. * `phrase`. The search query must contain one of the **Search terms** values as a subphrase, and in the same order. For example, if the **Search terms** value is `yellow shirt`, the rule is triggered by `yellow shirt` and `small yellow shirt`. The rule is not triggered if the value is `yellow small shirt`. * `text`. At least one of the **Search terms** values must match the query, but unlike `phrase`, the query only needs to match part of the value. For example, if the **Search terms** value is `green hat`, the rule is triggered by `green hat`, `green`, `hat`, and `large green hat`. | `keywords` |
| ✅ | **Search terms** | Search terms that will trigger the rule. Terms can be words or phrases. | `sale`, `shoes`, `red` |

#### Query profile

| Required | Parameter | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | **Query profile ID** | The ID of the query profile that allows the rule to fire. Accepts multiple values. | `EXAMPLE_APP` |

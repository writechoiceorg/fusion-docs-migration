This diagram shows the flow of signals data from the search app through Managed Fusion. The numbered steps are explained below.

1. The search app sends a query to a Managed Fusion query pipeline.

   The query request should include a user ID and session query parameter to identify the user.
2. Optionally, the Managed Fusion query pipeline queries the `COLLECTION_NAME_signals_aggr` collection to get boosts for the main query based on aggregated click data.
3. The search app also sends a request signal to the Managed Fusion [`/signals` endpoint](/managed-fusion/5.9/qkr054/signals-api).

   The primary intent of a request signal is to capture the raw user query and contextual information about the userâ€™s current activity in the app, such as the user agent and the page where they generated the query. The request signal does not contain any information about the results sent to Solr; it is created before a query is processed.
4. Once Solr returns the response to Managed Fusion, the SearchLogger component indexes the complete request/response data into the `COLLECTION_NAME_signals` collection as a response signal using the `_signals_ingest` pipeline. Therefore, the response signal captures all results from Managed Fusion as it related to the original query.

   <Note>
   Query activity is not indexed into the `_logs` collection. All response signals use the `fusion_query_id` (see below) as the unique document ID in Solr.
   </Note>
5. When the user clicks a link in the search results, the search app sends a click event to the Managed Fusion signals endpoint (which invokes the `_signals_ingest` pipeline behind the scenes).

   The click signal *must* include a field named `fusion_query_id` in the `params` object of the raw click signal. The `fusion_query_id` field is returned in the query response (from step 1) in a response header named `x-fusion-query-id`. This allows Managed Fusion to associate a click signal with the response signal generated in step 4. The `fusion_query_id` is also used by Managed Fusion to associate click signals with [experiments](/managed-fusion/5.9/mykfo7/experiments). For experiments to work, each click signal must contain the corresponding `fusion_query_id` that produced the document/item that was clicked.
6. The `_signals_ingest` pipeline enriches signals before indexing into the `COLLECTION_NAME_signals` collection.

   This enrichment includes field mapping, geolocation resolution, and updating the `has_clicks` flag to "true" on request signals when the first click signal is encountered for a given request using the [Update Related Document index stage](/managed-fusion/5.9/ek9zev/update-related-document-stage).
7. Managed Fusion queries the `COLLECTION_NAME_signals` collection through a Managed Fusion query pipeline to generate query analytics reports from raw signals.
8. Behind the scenes, the [SQL aggregation](/managed-fusion/5.9/78vsm6/sql-aggregation) framework aggregates click signals to compute a weight for each query + `doc_id` + filters group.

   The resulting metrics are saved to the `COLLECTION_NAME_signals_aggr` collection to generate boosts on queries to the main collection (step 2 above).
9. Recommendations also use aggregated documents in the `COLLECTION_NAME_signals_aggr` collection to build a [collaborative filtering-based recommender model](/managed-fusion/5.9/l0emoh/methods).

This topic provides information about page components you can manage to improve query results in Experience Optimizer.

## Document grouping

Experience Optimizer lets you define categories and group documents that are relevant to each other.

Options to group documents include:

* Block or boost. For example, promote a new document group to the top of the results for greater visibility.
* Apply rules individually to documents within a group. For example, boost ballet-related documents to the top of the group if a specific user searches for ballet dance contest.

### Best practices

These parameters group documents, and are defined in the Additional Query Parameters Stage:

| Parameter Name | Parameter Value | Update Policy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| group | true | default |
| group.format | grouped | default |
| group.ngroups | true | default |
| group.field | style_id_s | default |

For more information about adding a query pipeline and additional query parameters, see:

* [Add a Query Pipeline Stage](/how-to/56fmxr/add-a-query-pipeline-stage)
* [Additional Query Parameters Stage](/managed-fusion/5.9/8eo8x3/additional-query-parameters-stage)

### Collapse/Expand parser grouping

The Collapse/Expand parser allows grouping with the following parameters:

| Parameter Name | Parameter Value |
| --- | --- |
| expand | true |
| enableElevation | true |
| group | false |

<Note>
See [Collapse and Expand Results](https://solr.apache.org/guide/collapse-and-expand-results.html) for more information.

## Search rewrites

Search rewriting lets you modify search queries to more accurately reflect the intentions of your customers.

These functions let you:

* Create search rewrites manually.
* Edit, test, review and publish the search rewrites generated automatically from signals data.

For example, create a misspelling search rewrite to correct common spelling mistakes entered for a particular document. The misspelled query will then produce the same results as a correctly spelled search.

Experience Optimizer provides four rewrite types:

* [Head/Tail](/how-to/1r38or/use-eo-search-rewrites#head-tail) - improves poorly performing searches.
* [Misspelling detection](/how-to/1r38or/use-eo-search-rewrites#misspelling) - corrects common spelling mistakes.
* [Phrase detection](/how-to/1r38or/use-eo-search-rewritess#phrase) - identifies documents with matching phrases.
* [Synonym detection](/how-to/1r38or/use-eo-search-rewrites#synonym) - includes alternative words with the same meaning.

## Optimize zero results

Search queries that return zero results can drive customers away from your site. You can set certain documents to display when a customer search generates zero results.

For more information, see [Optimizing zero results](/how-to/t3oq7w/eo-zero-results).

## Rule conflict resolution

Sometimes, rules created in the [Rules Editor](/managed-fusion/5.9/nxpfuh/rules-editor) and Experience Optimizer conflict with each other. For example, if you have three rules to boost, bury, and block a document, Experience Optimizer highlights these conflicting rules so you can address them.

To highlight conflicting rules, the **Rules Fired** section displays a red warning icon next to the dominant rule and a red flag on the conflicting rules.

Click the **Edit** button to view the details of the conflicting rules and resolve the conflict.

The details of the conflicting rules affecting specific documents are found in the Document Details panel. Click the **Start Task** button, and then click the **Document Details** button.

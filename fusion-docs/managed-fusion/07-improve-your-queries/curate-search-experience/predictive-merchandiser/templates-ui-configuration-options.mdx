The Templates screen in the Rules Editor allows you to design, test, and implement a wide variety of search experiences. Results are conditionally delivered from multiple different query pipelines, enabling you to optimize search, browse, and AI-driven functionality throughout your site.

## Configuration options

### Templates

When creating or editing a template, the status is indicated after the template name.

<Frame>![Template active status](/assets/images/5.6/stale-example-56.png)</Frame>

The active status can hold the following values:

| Tag | New | Saved | Published | Active |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Editing** | ✅ |  |  |  |
| **Stale** |  | ✅ |  |  |
| (nothing) |  |  | ✅ | ✅ |

Configuration options for templates:

      <td>
        <p>If multiple templates are triggered, this setting determines which template is displayed. Lower numbers are considered higher precedence. For example, a template with precedence of <code>999</code> will trigger before a template with precedence of <code>1</code>.</p>

        <p>The type of template. This is an arbitrary value classifying the template. It has no effect on triggering/rendering logic unless the value is <code>Typeahead</code>. If <code>Typeahead</code> is assigned, the template will be excluded from <code>/trigger</code> and <code>/render</code> endpoints.</p>

      <td>
        <p>The conditions that must be met for the template to display.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
          <strong>Date Range.</strong> Define a date range to trigger the display of the template. For example, a desired template may be set to display during a Black Friday sales event.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Trigger.</strong> Define triggers to trigger the display of a template. Triggers are added with the <strong>Trigger</strong> button.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Search Term.</strong> Search terms required in the query for this trigger to match. The configured analysis will be applied to tokenize and process these terms.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Match Mode.</strong> Defines search terms matching criteria.
                <ul>
                  <li><code>phrase</code> requires the search tokens of this trigger to exist as a phrase within the search terms of the query. The phrase must be in the same order.</li>
                  <li><code>all</code> requires the search tokens of this trigger to exist within the search terms of the query in any order.</li>
                  <li><code>exact</code> requires that the search tokens in this trigger exactly match the search tokens in the query <em>in the same order</em>. As with all match modes, <code>exact</code> still applies the configured analysis, such as stemming. Singular and plural forms will be considered identical despite not being <em>exactly</em> the same.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Filters.</strong> Filters (<code>fq</code>) values required in the query for this trigger to match. Additional filters may be present and still satisfy this trigger.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Exact.</strong> If <strong>On</strong>, the nav state must match this trigger’s criteria exactly—no extra filters or terms allowed if none are defined. (Not to be confused with <code>exact</code> match mode.)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

#### Triggering

The date range trigger is activated alongside triggers with an `AND` logical operator. Conversely, triggers are activated alongside other triggers with an `OR` logical operator. For example, consider the following scenarios:

| Scenario 1 | | Scenario 2 | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Date Range | *none* | Date Range | `November 25, 2020 - December 5, 2020` |
| Search Term | `cyber monday` | Search Term | `cyber monday` |
| Search Term | `sales event` | Search Term | `sales event` |

In **Scenario 1**, no date range is configured. The template is triggered if:

* The user searches the term `cyber monday` *or* `sales event`.

In **Scenario 2**, a date range is configured. The template is triggered if:

* Today’s date is within the date range `November 25, 2020 - December 5, 2020`, *and* the user searches the term `cyber monday`
* Today’s date is within the date range `November 25, 2020 - December 5, 2020`, *and* the user searches the term `sales event`

The template is *not* triggered if:

* Today’s date is not within the date range `November 25, 2020 - December 5, 2020`
* Today’s date is within the date range `November 25, 2020 - December 5, 2020`, but the user does not search the term `cyber monday` *or* `sales event`

    <tr>
      <td>Type</td>
      <td>
        <p>An arbitrary value classifying the zone. It has no effect on triggering/rendering logic. Intended only to be used by the PM UI. This value is read-only and for informational purposes only.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Query Profile</td>
      <td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tags</td>
      <td>
        <p>Tags are passed to the query profile when rendering. They are combined with tags found in the request parameters of the render request.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Omit Filters from Query</td>
      <td>
        <p>If set to <strong>On</strong>, the filters (<code>fq</code>) are ignored. For example, if you want the zone to display items with type <code>sunglasses</code> even though the user has filtered the results to <code>shorts</code>, enabling this setting allows the zone to display sunglasses.</p>
      </td>

    <tr>
      <td>UI Treatment</td>
      <td>
        <p>Arbitrary text included in the response when rendering the zone. Generally used by the frontend to determine how to display the zone. UI Treatment tags accept a color value to help distinguish them in the Predictive Merchandiser screen:</p>

Product Image, Product Title, and Product Description are only used to render products in Predictive Merchandiser. Your search application will determine what fields are used in production.

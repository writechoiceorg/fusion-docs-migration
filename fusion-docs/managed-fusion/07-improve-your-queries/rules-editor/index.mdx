The Rules Editor allows you to view, edit, create, approve, enable, and publish rules powered by Managed Fusion. Access the Rules Editor from the Managed Fusion UI by navigating to **Relevance** > **Rules**:

<Frame>![Access the Rules Editor](/assets/images/5.6/access-rules-ui-56.png)</Frame>

A rule’s various states determine whether the rule is in effect for everyone using your search application:

| State | Options | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Status** | *Enabled* or *Disabled* | If a rule’s status is *Enabled*, the rule is in effect. If a rule’s status is *Disabled*, the rule is not in effect.  This is only true if the rule is published, as described below. |
| **Review** | *Approved* or *Denied* | If a rule’s review state is *Approved*, and you publish the changes, the latest changes to that rule are in effect. If the state is *Denied*, and you publish the changes, the Rules Manager deletes the rule. <Warning> **Caution** Unlike deleting the rule with the UI, if you delete the rule by publishing it while in a *Denied* review state, you cannot undo the action. </Warning> |
| **Published** | *Yes* or *No* | If a rule’s published state is *Yes*, the latest changes to the rule are in effect. If the state is *No*, the latest changes are not in effect.  This also applies to changes to the rule’s status, such as disabling to rule. |

## Signals data

<Frame>![Signals Data](/assets/images/5.1/ai-rules/ui/rules-ui-dashboard-signals.png)</Frame>

* **Top Null Searches.** The top search terms that yielded 0 results. A null search is considered a poor user experience. Use [query rewrites](/how-to/lfx7b8/use-query-rewrites-in-the-rules-editor) to reduce the likelihood of a visitor receiving 0 results.
* **Top Search Terms.** The most commonly searched terms.
* **Top Clicked Products.** The most commonly clicked products or documents. This may include searches, recommendations, static links, or outside referrals.
* **Top Clicked Searches.** The most common searches that resulted in a click.
* **Top Purchased Products.** The most commonly purchased products. This may include searches, recommendations, static links, or referrals.
* **Top Purchased Searches.** The most commonly purchased products that were identified from a search.

<Tip>
Use [query rewrites](/how-to/lfx7b8/use-query-rewrites-in-the-rules-editor) to adapt your search results and guide visitors to top clicked and top purchased products.

## Predictive Merchandiser and Experience Optimizer

Predictive Merchandiser and Experience Optimizer are both AI-powered tools that provide insights, customer recommendations, and search optimization in a single comprehensive product.

<Frame>![Predictive Merchandiser Board](/assets/images/predictive-merchandiser/pm-board.png)</Frame>

Predictive Merchandiser and Experience Optimizer are separate offerings from Managed Fusion. See the [Predictive Merchandiser documentation](/managed-fusion/5.9/74h98q/predictive-merchandiser) for more information.

## Rules

<Frame>![Rules Editor Business Rules](/assets/images/5.6/rules-ui-business-rules-56.png)</Frame>

The Rules screen is used to create [business rules](/managed-fusion/5.9/03vd0y/business-rules) within the Rules Editor.

Business rules are manually-created formulas for rewriting queries. This is the most versatile strategy for creating custom query rewrites. It supports a variety of conditions and actions to address a wide range of use cases. When you need a very specific query rewrite, this is the best strategy.

Business rules are applied in the [Apply Rules stage](/managed-fusion/5.9/yx85m4/apply-rules-stage) of the query pipeline.

Learn how to use [business rules in the Rules Editor](/how-to/rcmii7/use-business-rules-in-the-rules-editor).

### UI elements

#### Facets

* **Action.** The [built-in rule action](/managed-fusion/5.9/03vd0y/business-rules#built-in-rule-actions) for the rule.
* **Status.** Whether a rule is enabled or disabled.
* **Published.** Whether or not a rule has been published.
* **Created Date.** The date the rule was created.
* **Expiration Date.** The date the rule expires.

#### Rules list

The rules list can be faceted, searched, or sorted according to the various values the rules hold.

## Rewrite

<Frame>![Rules Editor Query Rewrites](/assets/images/5.6/rules-ui-rewrite-56.png)</Frame>

Learn how to use the [Rules Editor query rewrites](/how-to/lfx7b8/use-query-rewrites-in-the-rules-editor).

### UI elements

#### Facets

* **Status.** Whether a rule is enabled or disabled.
* **Published.** Whether or not a rule has been published.
* **Confidence.** The confidence score for the rule. A confidence score is automatically set by Managed Fusion. It can be manually set for user-created rules. The confidence score is used, in part, to decided whether a rule is automatically published or not. See [Query Rewriting concepts](/managed-fusion/5.9/tw7rlx/query-rewriting) for more information.

  <Note>
  **Confidence** is not used for Head/Tail query rewrites.
  </Note>

#### Rules list

You can facet, search, or sort the rules list according to the values the rules hold.

##### Rule type selectors

There are buttons at the top of the rules list that allow you to choose what query rewrite rule types you would like to work with:

<Frame>![Query rewrite rule types](/assets/images/5.1/ai-rules/ui/rules-ui-rewrite-rule-types.png)</Frame>

* **Head/Tail.** Replace underperforming queries with queries that produce higher click-through rates. Query improvements always require review before they are published. Schedule the Head/Tail analysis job to get AI-generated query improvements based on your signals collection. See [Head/Tail analysis](/managed-fusion/5.9/a024os/head-tail-analysis).
* **Misspelling.** Managed Fusion replaces misspelled query terms with their spelling corrections for better search results. Schedule the Token and Phrase Spell Correction job to get AI-generated spelling corrections based on your signals collection. See [Misspelling Detection](/managed-fusion/5.9/231w02/misspelling-detection).
* **Phrase.** Known phrases are boosted when they appear in new queries. Schedule the Phrase Extraction job to get AI-generated phrases based on your signals collection. See [Phrase Detection](/managed-fusion/5.9/olq4c4/phrase-detection).
* **Synonym.** Synonyms expand queries so that they include all known synonyms of the query terms. Schedule the Synonym Detection job to get AI-generated synonyms based on your signals collection. See [Synonym Detection](/managed-fusion/5.9/a2jy7t/synonym-detection-jobs).
* **Remove Words.** Remove particular phrases from queries. Unlike other rewrites, these should be entered manually and are not generated by a job. See [Remove Words](/managed-fusion/5.9/k03fvq/remove-words).

## Templates

The Templates screen in the Rules Editor allows you to design, test, and implement a wide variety of search experiences. Results are conditionally delivered from multiple different query pipelines, enabling you to use Managed Fusion’s search, browse, and AI-driven functionality throughout your site.

<Frame>![Template Manager](/assets/images/predictive-merchandiser/templates/template-manager02.png)</Frame>

Templates are only available with a valid license for [Predictive Merchandiser](/managed-fusion/5.9/74h98q/predictive-merchandiser). If available, you will see the templates icon in the left navigation panel: <InlineImage src="/assets/images/predictive-merchandiser/templates/icon-templates.png"/>

## Simulator

The Simulator provides an interactive preview of how your staged rules affect relevancy, using your search data and a simple search interface. When you enter a query, the Simulator shows you the triggered rules, in the order in which they were triggered, along with any triggered facets.

You can edit any of the triggered rules, then re-run the query to see new results.

The Simulator sends requests to the `COLLECTION_NAME_rules_simulator` query profile, which you can configure to point to any pipeline and collection in your app.

The Simulator is only visible in the Rules Editor if you *do not* have a valid license for [Predictive Merchandiser](/managed-fusion/5.9/74h98q/predictive-merchandiser). If available, the simulator icon appears in the left navigation panel.

### Search

<Frame>![Simulator search bar](/assets/images/5.1/ai-rules/simulator-example-query.png)</Frame>

Use the search bar in the top nav panel to simulate, or preview, your staged rules.

### Rule indicators

After entering a search query, the active rules affecting the results appear above the results. For example, a query for the term `keyboard` with a query rewrite rule would display an indicator for the rewritten query `wireless keyboard` in the left panel of the Simulator:

<Frame>![Active query rewrite rules](/assets/images/5.1/ai-rules/simulator-example-query02-framed.png)</Frame>

You can edit the query rewrite rule by hovering over this indicator and clicking the edit button. A dialog box appears:

<Frame>![Rule indicator edit](/assets/images/5.1/ai-rules/simulator-example-query03.png)</Frame>

Similarly, when a business rule is triggered by a search condition, it appears in the right panel of the Simulator:

<Frame>![Active business rules](/assets/images/5.1/ai-rules/simulator-example-query04.png)</Frame>

## Analytics

<Frame>![Rules Editor Analytics](/assets/images/5.6/rules-ui-analytics-56.png)</Frame>

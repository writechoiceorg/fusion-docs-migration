Head/tail analysis is:

* Also known as the Underperforming Query Rewriting feature
* Uses signals data to identify underperforming queries
* Suggests improved queries that could produce better conversion rates

When an incoming query contains a matching underperforming query, the original query is replaced by an improved query.
These improvements can be:

* Suggested by the [Head/Tail Analysis Spark job](/managed-fusion/5.9/14bjqz/head-tail-analysis-jobs) operating on your signals data
* Created manually using the [Rules Editor](/managed-fusion/5.9/nxpfuh/rules-editor) or underlying API

Query improvements are applied in the [Text Tagger stage](/managed-fusion/5.9/74ygo4/text-tagger-stage) of the query pipeline.

The [Head/Tail Analysis job](/managed-fusion/5.9/14bjqz/head-tail-analysis-jobs) automatically creates query improvements based on your AI-generated data. When you navigate to **Relevance** > **Rules** > **Rewrite** and select the **Head/Tail** tab, the application displays the **Underperforming Query Rewriting** screen.

<Note>
Job-generated query improvements are always assigned an initial status of "Pending", never "Auto". Query improvements must be explicitly approved and published in order to be copied to the `COLLECTION_NAME_query_rewrite` collection.

## Reviewing auto-generated query improvements

Query improvements that are automatically generated by the [Head/Tail Analysis job](/managed-fusion/5.9/14bjqz/head-tail-analysis-jobs) are assigned the following status value:

* **Auto**

  All results will be automatically deployed to the `_query_rewrite` collection.

  No action is required on these results, but you can edit them if you wish.

## Adding new query improvements

You can manually add query improvements in addition to any generated by the [Head/Tail Analysis job](/managed-fusion/5.9/14bjqz/head-tail-analysis-jobs).

### How to add a query improvement

1. Navigate to **Relevance** > **Rules** > **Rewrite**.
2. Select the **Head/Tail** tab. The application displays the **Underperforming Query Rewriting** screen.
3. At the bottom of the rules list, click the <InlineImage src="/assets/images/4.2/icons/add-rule.png"/> icon.

   A new query improvement appears at the top of the list:

   <Frame>![Add a query improvement](/assets/images/5.4/add-head-tail-query.png)</Frame>
4. Enter the underperforming query.
5. Enter one or more query improvements.

   <Tip>
   It is not necessary to set a confidence value.
   </Tip>
6. Select the query improvement’s status, depending on whether you want to deploy it the next time you publish your changes ("Approved") or save it for further review ("Pending").
7. Click the check mark to save the new query improvement.

## Publishing your changes

### How to publish updated query improvements

1. In the **Underperforming Query Rewriting** screen, click the **PUBLISH** button.

   Managed Fusion prompts you to confirm that you want to publish your changes.
2. Click **PUBLISH**.

<Tip>
You can un-publish a query rewrite by changing its status to "denied", then clicking **PUBLISH**.
</Tip>

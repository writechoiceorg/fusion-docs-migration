Release notes provide detailed descriptions of the relevant changes included with each Fusion release, including new features, improvements, bug fixes, and more.

<Note>
**Important**

Prior to [Managed Fusion 5.9.5](/managed-fusion/5.12/4q0hzl/managed-fusion-5-9-5), Managed Fusion release notes were included within the [Fusion release notes](/fusion/5.9/97/release-notes). Moving forward, Managed Fusion release notes will be documented separately in this section.

## Deprecations and Removals

Every Managed Fusion release adds or improves Managed Fusion features and functionality. Occasionally, Lucidworks "deprecates" features, and they are no longer maintained, updated, or supported. Deprecated features should be planned for eventual removal. In many cases, new features are introduced which replace or improve the functionality of the deprecated feature.

Fusion and Managed Fusion share the same deprecations and removals documentation. See Fusionâ€™s [Deprecations and Removals](/fusion/5.9/8855/deprecations-and-removals) for a comprehensive list of active deprecations and removals for both Fusion and Managed Fusion.

How long do I have before the feature is removed?

Lucidworks gives a minimum of one minor release cycle before removing a deprecated feature. For example:

* A feature is deprecated in Fusion 5.2.0, so it will not be removed before Fusion 5.3.0
* A feature is deprecated in Fusion 5.2.1, so it will not be removed before Fusion 5.3.0

<Note>
Deprecations are typically made in major and minor releases only. Maintenance release deprecations are less common.

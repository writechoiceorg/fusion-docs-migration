### Expanded availability for ConfigSync

Lucidworks has long utilized ConfigSync internally for Managed Fusion environments to maintain consistent and up-to-date configuration settings across multiple environments. Now, ConfigSync is available to self-hosted clients using Fusion 5.9.8 and later.

## Deprecations

For full details on deprecations, see [Deprecations and Removals](/managed-fusion/5.9/dv9ib2/deprecations-and-removals#deprecations).

As part of our ongoing commitment to providing a modern, efficient, and secure product, Lucidworks is officially deprecating support for the Nashorn JavaScript engine in Managed Fusion 5.9.8. Users are advised to use the OpenJDK Nashorn engine, a robust and actively maintained alternative, for all JavaScript pipeline stages.

The deprecation aligns with industry trends and ensures compatibility with modern tools and frameworks. OpenJDK Nashorn provides enhanced performance, improved support, and ongoing updates, making it the ideal replacement.

<Danger>
**FAQ**

How long will Lucidworks continue to support Nashorn?

Nashorn will remain available for at least 6 months from the release of Managed Fusion 5.9.8. All Nashorn-related features and integrations will be removed in a release after this 6-month period.
</Danger>

To prepare for the eventual removal of Nashorn in a future release, Lucidworks strongly recommends beginning the migration of your pipelines to OpenJDK Nashorn:

* **Audit your code.** Identify all areas where Nashorn is used in your applications.
* **Plan your migration.** Transition your JavaScript pipelines from Nashorn to OpenJDK Nashorn. Be sure to thoroughly test compatibility with your configurations to ensure a smooth transition.
* **Seek support.** Lucidworks is available to assist with any migration questions or challenges. Please contact your Client Excellence team if you have any questions.

We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in this transition. Thank you for ensuring the continued evolution and efficiency of your workflows.

<Tip>
You can select the OpenJDK Nashorn engine in the pipeline views or in the workbenches:

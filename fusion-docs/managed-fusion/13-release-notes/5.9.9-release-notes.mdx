Released on January 29, 2025, this [maintenance release](/policies/7shln5/lucidworks-version-support-lifecycle#maintenance-release-support-policy) delivers essential security enhancements, including the latest updates for Kafka and key improvements for future-ready protection, plus bug fixes.

## Key highlights

### Enhanced Security and Future-Ready Safeguards

With the Managed Fusion 5.9.9 release, we’ve upgraded Kafka to version 3.7.0, incorporating the latest security updates to strengthen your platform’s resilience. Additionally, we’ve implemented critical updates for Managed Fusion’s Webapps, Templating, and API Gateway services, ensuring robust protection for your data.

Looking ahead, we’ve introduced enhancements to streamline and expedite the delivery of future security updates, providing you with a safer Managed Fusion environment.

### Secure deployments with immutable root file system

Fusion now supports a read-only root file system to safeguard against unauthorized modifications, protecting your deployment against malicious software and other attacks.
Most services operate efficiently in this mode, and for components that need write access, a separate writable mount is available.

Read-only mode is enabled by default for some Managed Fusion services.
See [Read-only root file system](/managed-fusion/5.9/yu6e93/security#read-only-root-file-system) for a list of services that support it or have it enabled by default.
It should only be enabled for services that do not require CRUD access.
Contact Lucidworks to customize how read-only root file system access is configured for your Managed Fusion deployment.

## Bug fixes

* This release improves compatibility between Solr and Managed Fusion’s [LWAI Prediction index pipeline stage](/fusion/5.9/bzik28/lwai-prediction) to prevent errors about incompatible characters in field names.

* The Managed Fusion API realm can now authenticate when an API key is passed via an `apiKey` parameter.

    Previously, the key could only be passed in the header, as in these examples:

    ```bash
    curl -H "x-api-key: API_KEY" "https://EXAMPLE_COMPANY.b.lucidworks.cloud/api/query/status"
    curl -H "apiKey: API_KEY" "https://EXAMPLE_COMPANY.b.lucidworks.cloud/api/query/status"
    ```

    Now you can also pass the key as a parameter, like this:

    ```bash
    curl https://EXAMPLE_COMPANY.b.lucidworks.cloud/api/query/status?apiKey=API_KEY
    ```

* The [Configurations](/fusion/5.11/342/configurations-api) and [ZooKeeper Import/Export](/fusion/5.11/320/zoo-keeper-import-export-api) APIs are now accessible only to authorized users from within Managed Fusion.

**FAQ**

How long will Lucidworks continue to support these connectors?

These connectors will remain available for at least 6 months from the release of Managed Fusion 5.9.9 and will be removed in a release after this 6-month period.

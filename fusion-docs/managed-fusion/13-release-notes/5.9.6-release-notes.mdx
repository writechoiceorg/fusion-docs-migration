## New Features

### Cloud signal storage for Managed Fusion

Managed Fusion now offers the flexibility to store signals data in Google Cloud Storage or Amazon S3, providing an alternative to the default Solr storage. Cloud signal storage minimizes the storage burden on your Solr cluster, potentially leading to improved performance and resource optimization.

All signal types, including custom types, are fully supported for cloud storage. Additionally, customization of the default signal schema remains available. Signals data files are automatically compacted over time, resulting in significant storage space savings and simplified file management.

Cloud signal storage is enabled during initial deployment. For more information, see [Cloud signal storage for Managed Fusion](/managed-fusion/5.9/vcpe1e/cloud-signal-storage).

### Support for Open Nashorn

Now your pipeline definitions can include your choice of JavaScript engine, either "Nashorn" or "OpenJDK Nashorn".
You can select the JavaScript engine in the pipeline views.
Your JavaScript pipeline stages are interpreted by the selected engine.

<Note>
While Nashorn is the default option, it is in the process of being deprecated and will eventually be removed, so it is recommended to use OpenJDK Nashorn when possible.

## Improvements

* Remote V2 Connectors now support the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Application Load Balancer (ALB) for ingress.
  See [Configure Remote V2 Connectors](/how-to/gy3add/configure-remote-v-2-connectors#enable-backend-ingress) for configuration details.

  <Note>
  Remote V2 Connectors are not available by default. Contact your Lucidworks representative for more information about enabling them in your Managed Fusion deployment.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue that caused the API Gateway service to return a `401` error code for `400` errors.

* Fixed an issue that passed redacted configuration values to Fusion, resulting in invalid configurations.

* Fixed an issue that sometimes caused intermittent errors in Machine Learning stages.

* Fixed an issue where the `sourceType` query parameter was not being conveyed to Lucidworks AI.

* Fixed an issue that prevented the correct display of some UI panels for non-admin users.

* Fixed an issue where the names of some of the configuration checkboxes for the Web connector were truncated.

* Fixed an issue with the Web 1.4.0 connector that, in rare cases, prevented the client secret from being saved.

* Fixed an issue that caused a `Class cannot be created (missing no-arg constructor)` error when a response document contained an undefined value.

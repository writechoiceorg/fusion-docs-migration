Index pipelines transform incoming data into `PipelineDocument` objects for indexing by Managed Fusion-managed Solr service.
An index pipeline consists of a series of configurable
[index pipeline stages](/managed-fusion/5.9/50yh1o/index-pipeline-stages),
each performing a different transformation on the data before passing the result to the next stage in the pipeline.
The final stage is the
[Solr Indexer stage](/managed-fusion/5.9/0e45zf/solr-indexer-stage),
which transforms the PipelineDocument into a Solr document and submits it to Solr for indexing in a specific
[Collection](/managed-fusion/5.9/n8oj99/collections).

Each configured datasource has an associated index pipeline and uses a
[connector](/managed-fusion/5.9/lefwp2/connectors-configuration-reference)
to fetch data to parse and then input into the index pipeline.

Alternatively, documents can be submitted directly to an index pipeline or profile with the REST API; see
[Importing Data with the REST API](/how-to/5qfjgg/import-data-with-the-rest-api).

A pipeline can be reused across multiple collections. Managed Fusion provides a set of built-in pipelines. You can use the Index Workbench or the
[REST API](/managed-fusion/5.9/m6at2r/index-pipelines-api)
to develop custom index pipelines to suit any datasource or application.

Managed Fusion creates a default index pipeline when you create an app. The index pipeline has the same name as the app. This pipeline consists of a [Field Mapping index stage](/managed-fusion/5.9/ea0urj/field-mapping-index-stage).

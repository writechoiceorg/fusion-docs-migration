Index profiles let your applications [send documents for indexing to a consistent endpoint](/how-to/5qfjgg/import-data-with-the-rest-api) (the index profile endpoint) and change the underlying index pipeline as needed.

An index profile is also a simple way to use one pipeline for multiple collections, without any one collection "owning" the pipeline. Associating a profile with an index pipeline, or an index pipeline and a collection, is simply a mapping.

Finally, you can also specify configuration parameters for an index pipeline in the index profile.

You can use the API or UI to manage index profiles.

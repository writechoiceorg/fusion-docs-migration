**FAQ**

**How is Managed Fusion different from Fusion?**

Lucidworks takes care of deployments, upgrades, and high availability for your Managed Fusion instance. Additionally, some features and capabilities may be available only in Fusion or only in Managed Fusion.

## Features

### Connectors

Managed Fusion offers dozens of connectors so you can access your data from a large number of sources, including [Amazon AWS S3](/fusion-connectors/8851/aws-s-3-v-2), [SharePoint](/fusion-connectors/3qqudu/share-point-optimized-v-2), or almost [any website](/fusion-connectors/tq6l3z/web-v-2). Your data moves through the [indexing Data Flow](/managed-fusion/5.9/uwmzgu/index-data), where it is transformed to meet the specific needs of your use case.

To learn more about Managed Fusion connectors, see [Lucidworks Connectors](/fusion-connectors/2/fusion-connectors).

### Signals

Signals are recorded user events that provide insights on user behavior. Almost any user event can be captured as a signal, including when a user clicks a search result, adds an item to their cart, or makes a purchase. Managed Fusion uses signals to improve search result relevancy and deliver the right results to the right users.

For more information on signals, see [Signals](/managed-fusion/5.9/ws4w2h/signals).

### Rules

Rules are manually created formulas for rewriting queries. This is the most versatile strategy for creating custom query rewrites. It supports a variety of conditions and actions to address a wide range of use cases.

Use rules to boost, bury, or block results to customize your search experience, or take it further with other rule actions.

For more information on rules, see [Business rules](/managed-fusion/5.9/03vd0y/business-rules).

### Recommendations

Create personalized recommendations for users based on signals data, even if they have not performed a search. Use these recommendations with search-driven assets to drive users to the most relevant content.

* **Items-for-item.** Customers shopping for bicycles may be interested in more items, such as a helmet and bike lock. Use items-for-items recommendations to surface those items for them.
* **Items-for-query.** Sometimes, semantic relevance is not the same as user relevance. Items-for-query recommendations show items commonly associated with a query, based on user behavior.
* **Items-for-user.** Winter clothing needs are different for customers in Arizona versus Alaska. Items-for-user recommendations help each customer find what works best for them.
* **Queries-for-query.** Help users who are not finding the right words. Queries-for-query recommendations show queries that are related to the current query.
* **Trending items and queries.** Show items that have been popular lately, so customers can see the latest and greatest.
* **Users-for-item.** Find which users have interacted with specific items, and reach out with your marketing campaign.

For more information on recommendations, see [Recommendations](/managed-fusion/5.9/k90ww9/recommendations).

### Search curation

Predictive Merchandiser and Experience Optimizer are AI-powered tools that provide insights, customer recommendations, and search optimization.

Predictive Merchandiser is designed for product discovery, such as ecommerce. Experience Optimizer is designed for knowledge management. For example, a site providing news, information, or documentation.

For more information on these tools, see [Curate your search experience](/managed-fusion/5.9/zw2obu/curate-your-search-experience).

## Technology

Managed Fusion builds upon trusted technology that makes it reliable, secure, fast, and effective. Major components of its technology stack include Kubernetes, Solr, Spark, and ZooKeeper.

**Kubernetes**
    Kubernetes is a container orchestration service used for deploying, scaling, and managing distributed applications. Managed Fusion uses Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and benefits from Googleâ€™s global infrastructure, security, and support.

**Apache Solr**
    Solr is a highly reliable and scalable search platform. Managed Fusion uses Solr to index and query billions of documents and serve millions of users.

**Apache Spark**
    Spark is an analytics engine used by Managed Fusion for large-scale data processing. This includes processing millions of signals and generating recommendations.

**Apache ZooKeeper**
    ZooKeeper is a distributed configuration service that Managed Fusion uses to configure your components and keep them consistent within your deployment.

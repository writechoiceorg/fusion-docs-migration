Tracking your metrics and analytics help you to understand how your search is performing and how your users are interacting with your search. You can use this data to continue improving your search apps over time. Managed Fusion has several features built in to track your experiment results, search data, and signals data.

## Experiments

Experiments let you test any changes you make to your query pipeline or query paramers to verify that the results work as intended for your users. [Experiments](/managed-fusion/5.9/mykfo7/experiments) provide A/B testing and [metrics](/managed-fusion/5.9/wkwyg1/experiment-metrics).

## App Insights

App Insights provides detailed, real-time, searchable reports and visualizations derived from your [signals data](/managed-fusion/5.9/ws4w2h/signals). It also provides alerts and triggers to notify you when specific events occur.

## Managed Fusion system metrics

Managed Fusion system metrics are logged and available in the UI, in log files, and through the REST API. For information on monitoring and system status, see [Monitoring](/managed-fusion/5.9/tfhq50/monitoring).

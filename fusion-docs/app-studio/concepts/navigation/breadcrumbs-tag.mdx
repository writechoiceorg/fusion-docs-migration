The Breadcrumbs tag outputs the components of the Query for example, the query string and filters. If the original Query is provided to the tag via an attribute then HTML will automatically be generated to display and allow the removal of individual filters.

## Usage

This example shows how to add breadcrumbs to the page. When no body is specified for the tag, Appkit will generate appropriate HTML.

```xml
<search:breadcrumbs response="response"></search:breadcrumbs>
```

For a complete list of attributes, see the [`search:breadcrumbs`](/fusion/5.9/1131/search-breadcrumbs) tag doc.

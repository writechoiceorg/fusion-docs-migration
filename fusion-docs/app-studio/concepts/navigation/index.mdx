The articles in this section describe Appkit tags used for navigation.

* [Breadcrumbs](/fusion/5.9/3104/breadcrumbs-tag)

    The Breadcrumbs tag outputs the components of the Query for example, the query string and filters. If the original Query is provided to the tag via an attribute then HTML will automatically be generated to display and allow the removal of individual filters.
    
* [Faceted Navigation](/fusion/5.9/3105/faceted-navigation)

    Faceted navigation is one of the most powerful features of search. Appkit provides simple tags for rendering lists of facets and filters in your application, while also providing a single widget that handles many of the complexities of faceted navigation for you.
    
* [Tabs](/fusion/5.9/3107/tabs-tag)

    The Tabs tag displays user interface components for tab-based navigation or filtering. The tag can be used to either output path-based tabs or filter tabs.

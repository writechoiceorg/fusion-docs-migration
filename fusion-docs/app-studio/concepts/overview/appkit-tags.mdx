Appkit provides a range of client-side tags for building and executing search queries as well as displaying, formatting and visualization of search results.

These tags are packaged as AngularJS libraries divided into a number of namespaces. See the [Tag Reference](/fusion/5.9/1134/tags) for full documentation on each of the tags.

Most Appkit tags can be used in various combinations and are designed to work together within the framework to deliver a high quality search experience for the user.

## Common usage

This example demonstrates how the result-list tag works in line with our principles of *configuration over code* and *sensible defaults*.

To render a simple results list displaying every field in each document, this code is all that is required in the JSP:

```xml
<search:result-list response="response"></search:result-list>

```

If you want to go ahead and customize the output of a result list, you can easily do so along these lines:

```xml
<search:result-list response="response">
     <search:result>
          <search:field name="title" style="title"></search:field>
          <search:field name="url" style="url" label="Link:"></search:field>
          <search:field name="description" style="description" label="Abstract:"></search:field>
     </search:result>
</search:result-list>
```

This demonstrates a common pattern in Appkit of basic tags having default rendering to get you started, with the ability to customize the rendering of elements within them to a suitable level of granularity.

## Configuration

Many tags have reasonable default configurations, but they can also pick up attributes from configuration files, avoiding the must change any JSP code:

Here is a platform tag which looks for properties in the configuration file at `src/main/resources/conf/platforms/myplatform/dev.conf`

```xml
<search:platform var="platform" conf="platform.myplatform.dev"></search:platform>
```

See section on [configuration files](/fusion/5.9/3092/configuration-files) for more information.

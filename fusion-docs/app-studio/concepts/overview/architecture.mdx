Appkit is a stateless, modular, 100% Java Standard Edition software framework.

## Architecture

Appkit consists of:

* A layer of [data-abstraction middleware](/fusion/5.9/3117/data-sources)
* A collection of functional [modules](/fusion/5.9/3142/modules) for data manipulation
* [User interface components](/fusion/5.9/3114/user-interface-components) for rendering and visualizing the data

An Appkit search application consists of modular building blocks, which are pieced together through the use of special [Appkit tags](/fusion/5.9/3121/appkit-tags), which can be mixed in with standard HTML and JSP code.

## Technology stack

The Appkit stack is designed to be lightweight from the point of view of efficiency and ease of development. No programming or Java code is necessary to build a search application with Appkit.

### Software that Appkit uses

Appkit uses:

* Maven for server side dependencies and build management
* npm 9.0.2 for client side dependencies
* Standard Java 1.8 Servlets and JSPs
* Standards-compliant AngularJS, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### What Appkit provides

Appkit provides:

* A self-service application generator for project generation
* AngularJS based tag libraries for all framework components
* Web services to expose all search functionality
* Extension points for custom tags, JavaScript, and CSS

### Deployment options

Appkit applications can be:

* Deployed locally in a development environment using the Maven Jetty plugin
* Built to a standard WAR file for deployment on Tomcat (or any other servlet container/application server)

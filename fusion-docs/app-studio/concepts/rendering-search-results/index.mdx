Search results are the focus of every search interface, and Appkit makes it easy to forge the results precisely to your liking.

## Result Lists

To add a list of results containing every available field, use a Result List tag on its own:

```xml
<search:result-list response="response"></search:result-list>
```

To choose which fields are displayed, add the Result tag inside the body of the Result List tag:

```xml
<search:result-list response="response">
    <search:result>
        ...
    </search:result>
</search:result-list>
```

## Working with fields

Inside the Result tag, use the Field tag to specify and configure each field:

```xml
<search:result-list response="response">
    <search:result>

        <search:field name="title" />
        <search:field name="description" />

    </search:result>
</search:result-list>
```

The Result tag renders if results are available. It outputs a single result, and must be nested within a Result List tag. The No Results tag renders if no results are available.

## Result tag

The Result tag renders if results are available. It outputs a single result, and must be nested within a Result List tag.

```xml
<search:result-list response="response">
    <search:result>
        <search:field name="title"></search:field>
        <search:field name="description"></search:field>
    </search:result>
</search:result-list>
```

See the [`search:result`](/fusion/5.9/1085/search-result) tag doc for all available attributes.

## Conditional result tag

It is also possible to use the result tag to conditionally display a set of fields based on the value of a given field. This is useful when each result fit into a specific *category*.

### Usage

The syntax is as follows:

```xml
<search:result-list response="response">
    <search:result a-field-name="fieldValue">
        <search:field name="title"></search:field>
        <search:field name="description"></search:field>
    </search:result>
    <search:result a-field-name="otherFieldValue">
        <search:field name="otherTitle"></search:field>
        <search:field name="otherDescription"></search:field>
    </search:result>
</search:result-list>
```

For example, if you had 2 types of results, documents and people, with different fields, you could display them in a single result list as follows:

```xml
<search:result-list response="response">
    <search:result type="people">
        <search:field name="name"></search:field>
        <search:field name="date-of-birth"></search:field>
    </search:result>
    <search:result type="document">
        <search:field name="title"></search:field>
        <search:field name="author"></search:field>
    </search:result>
</search:result-list>
```

It is also possible to combine multiple conditions. All have to be met for the specific `<search:result>` tag to be selected. For example:

```xml
<search:result-list response="response">
    <search:result type="people" country="Vietnam">
        <h1>Vietnam</h1>
        <search:field name="name"></search:field>
        <search:field name="date-of-birth"></search:field>
    </search:result>
    <search:result type="people">
        <h1>Rest of the World</h1>
        <search:field name="name"></search:field>
        <search:field name="date-of-birth"></search:field>
    </search:result>
</search:result-list>
```

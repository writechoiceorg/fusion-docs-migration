The Result List tag displays the results for a given Response. While it can be used as a standalone tag to output every field for each result, it is most often contains a Result tag with numerous Field tags.

## Usage

This example shows how to display all results returned by the Platform. It shows two alternative methods of referencing the fields of each item:

* Using angular syntax to use the value directly
* Using the Field tag to produce strictly valid XHTML with comprehensive CSS selectors.

```xml
<search:result-list response="response">
     <search:result>
          <h2><a ng-href="{{result | field:'url' | actual}}" target="_top">{{result | field:'title' | actual}}</a></h2>
          <search:field name="body" label=""></search:field>
          <search:field name="concepts" label="concepts" query="query" separator=";"></search:field>
     </search:result>
</search:result-list>
```

While not strictly required, the nested `<search:result>` tag is recommended. For more details, refer to the [Result tag](/fusion/5.9/3094/result-tags).

## Nested Result Lists

Some search platforms, such as Solr (when using Grouping) will create Results with further nested Results. In Appkit terminology these are named 'related results'. A JOIN will produce a secondary set of hits for each result in the response. This secondary set of hits can be accessed and output using a nested Result List tag:

```xml
<search:result-list response="response">
    <search:result>
        <search:field name="country" label="" value-element="h2"></search:field>
        <search:field name="text" label=""></search:field>
        <search:field name="climate" label="Climate" query="query"></search:field>
        <h3>Cities in {{result | field:'title' | actual}}</h3>

        <!-- Nested list of related Results -->
        <search:result-list results="result.related">
            <search:result>
                <search:field name="city" label=""></search:field>
            </search:result>
        </search:result-list>
    </search:result>
</search:result-list>
```

See the [`search:result-list`](/fusion/5.9/1200/search-result-list) tag doc for all available attributes.

### Tag body variables

The body of the tag will be repeated for every result in the Response.

`${result} (twigkit.model.Result)`  
The result being output. See the Result for available properties.

* To get a String representation of a Field use: `{{result | field:'name' | actual}}` or `{{result | field:'title' | display}}`.

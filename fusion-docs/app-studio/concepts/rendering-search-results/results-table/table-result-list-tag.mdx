The Table Result List tag displays the results for a given search response in a table. The body of the Table Result List tag contains a [Header](/fusion/5.9/3102/header-tag) tag which outputs the top header of the table, and a [Body](/fusion/5.9/3099/table-body-tag) tag, which specifies the format of the rows of the table.

## Usage

This example shows how to display all results in a search response in a table.

```xml
<table:result-list response="response">
    <table:header>
        ...
    </table:header>
    <table:body>
        ...
    </table:body>
</table:result-list>
```

Appkit has advanced support for specifying custom URL patterns for filtering and grouping search results.

The Topic Pages module includes specialized versions of tags that work together to:

* Output links with a particular path structure according to a pattern
* Interpret the path of the current address to apply filters to a search.

This allows for a rich user interface which can help a user make sense of highly 'categorized' data and map different views of the data to readable URLs.

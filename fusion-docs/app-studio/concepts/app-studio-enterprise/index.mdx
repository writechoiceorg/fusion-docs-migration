App Studio Enterprise is a template for building a standalone Appkit application for Fusion. All of the instructions are self contained in the README and relevant configuration files and will lead you through the simple and easy process of configuring an App Studio application.

To get started, [download the latest copy](/fusion/5.9/992/app-studio-enterprise-downloads), and check out the instructions [here](/fusion/5.9/993/get-started-with-ase).

<Note>
Starting in Fusion 5.0, App Studio is no longer included in the Fusion UI. However, you can use App Studio Enterprise (ASE) to create apps in Fusion 5 *and* Fusion 4. See [How to Deploy App Studio Enterprise](/how-to/605/deploy-app-studio) for instructions.

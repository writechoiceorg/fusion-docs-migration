This article describes general app deployment with App Studio.

## Fusion Webapps service

[Fusion Web app deployment](/how-to/605/deploy-app-studio) gives you an embedded instance of App Studio in each of your Fusion instances.

## Standalone deployments

* [Java WAR file for deployment in a servlet container](/how-to/856/deploy-an-app-in-a-servlet-container)

  Package your search app in a Java WAR file, which can be deployed in a servlet container such as Tomcat or Jetty. This is the most common way to deploy a search app.
* [Java JAR file with embedded Tomcat web server](/how-to/714/deploy-a-standalone-app#embedded-tomcat-server)

  Package your search app in a Java JAR file that also contains an embedded Tomcat web server. The app is ready to deploy in a production environment. It is not necessary to build a WAR file and deploy that in a servlet container or application server.
* [Executable Java JAR file for execution in a Java runtime environment](/how-to/714/deploy-a-standalone-app#executable-java-jar-file)

  Package your search app in a Java JAR file. You can run the app with the Java launcher.

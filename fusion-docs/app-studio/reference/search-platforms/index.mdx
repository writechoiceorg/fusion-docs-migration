Appkit integrates with a number of search engines, data warehouses and web service endpoints, even surfacing information from multiple sources simultaneously. The platform abstraction covers both search and storage sides, meaning that Appkit will implement for each platform the necessary protocols to save or index content for any platform. A number of platform adapters are available out-of-the-box with Appkit, and [adding new ones](/fusion/5.9/3109/developing-platforms) is a simple exercise.

This is a summary of all types of data source currently supported by Appkit. Each data source has an associated set of connectors, that are responsible for brokering communications between the end-user and the underlying search endpoint. In each case, the corresponding search platform is typically configured through platform configuration files, all of which share a number of [common attributes](/fusion/5.9/3195/shared-platform-attributes).

The articles in this section describe key aspects of accessing data.

* [Configuring the Search Platform](/fusion/5.9/3129/configuring-the-search-platform)

  The Appkit search platform abstraction presents a unified way of carrying out common data operations such as searching, storing, and deleting information from the underlying repository. You can use multiple platforms on the same page to send a query to different repositories and aggregate the response. Each search platform is encapsulated as a `twigkit.platform.Platform` Java object.
* [Filter Syntax](/fusion/5.9/3124/filter-syntax)

  This article describes the syntax of a single Appkit search filter to include in an HTTP request.
* [Formulating a Query](/fusion/5.9/3125/formulating-a-query)

  The Appkit Query tag (`<search:query>`) instantiates a search query that can be submitted to the underlying search platform.
* [Search Response](/fusion/5.9/3127/search-responses)

  The Response tag (`<search:response>`) sends a Query to a given Platform and stores the Response in a JSP variable.

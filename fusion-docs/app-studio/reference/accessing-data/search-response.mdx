The Response tag (`<search:response>`) sends a Query to a given Platform and stores the Response in a JSP variable.

## Usage

This example shows how to submit a query using a given Platform and retrieve the response:

```xml
<search:response var="myResponse" platform="platform" query="query"></search:response>
```

The resulting response object can be accessed using an angular expression in the HTML page on which it is located. For example, `{{myResponse}}`.

## Configuration parameters

- `var (java.lang.String)`
    Variable name to reference the Response from the Platform.  
    Default: `response`

- `platform (twigkit.platform.Platform)`
    The Platform instance to use.

- `query (twigkit.model.Query)`
    An instance of an Appkit Query to send to the Platform.

- `errorPage (java.lang.String )`
    Error page to redirect to when Platform throws an exception.  
Default: `/WEB-INF/tags/widgets/error/error.jsp`

- `on (java.lang.String)`
    Event that is broadcasted for when the response should reload. Default: reloadSearch. (optional)

## Tag body

The body of the Response tag can be used to trigger a widget:spinner as the app waits for the response to return from the platform.

```xml
<search:response var="response" platform="platform" query="query" error-page="/error">
    <widget:spinner></widget:spinner>
</search:response>
```

The App Studio markup language defines a set of HTML-like elements, or *tags*, for defining search queries to the backend and visualizing the search results and facets, handling all the complexities of connecting to Fusion.

For example, adding a radial progress bar is as simple including the following tag:

```xml
<progress:radial
    percentage="56">
</progress:radial>
```

This results in the following:

Over 150 tags are provided in the Appkit framework.

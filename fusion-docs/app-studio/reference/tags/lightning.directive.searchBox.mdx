#### Parameters

| Param | Type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| response | **Object** | A response object |
| query  *(optional)* | **string** | The name of the query object |
| action  *(optional)* | **string** | Page the search should take place on, results will not change automatically when an action is set. |
| placeholder  *(optional)* | **string** | Placeholder for the search box |
| button-label  *(optional)* | **string** | Label of the button. |
| delay  *(optional)* | **number** | The delay before searching, not applicable if an action is set or instant search is being used. If a delay is greater then 1, results will load instantly on the page. |
| platform  *(optional)* | **string** | The platform to use for social search |
| size  *(optional)* | **string** | The size of the search box (tiny, small, large, huge, massive) |
| social  *(optional)* | **boolean** | Whether to enable the social features of the search header. Defaults to false. If you require a customized [Bookmark List Tag](/app-studio/4.2/1069/collaborate-bookmark-list) or [Saved Query List Tag](/app-studio/4.2/1073/collaborate-saved-query-list) you can add your own inside the search box tag and these will be used instead. |
| search-within-checkbox  *(optional)* | **boolean** | Show the 'search within' option as a checkbox. This enables the query to retain the filters already applied when checked. If not checked the search is reset when a query is entered and the form submitted. If you want this functionality but donâ€™t want a checkbox showing, you can use this attribute set to be false, and set `search-within-default-value` to be true - this uses a hidden field instead of a checkbox. |
| search-within-label  *(optional)* | **boolean** | The label for the 'search within' checkbox. |
| search-within-default-value  *(optional)* | **boolean** | Whether to enable 'search within' by default. The default is option is 'false'. |
| min-length  *(optional)* | **number** | The number of characters before a search is performed, only applicable for instant-results, query suggestions, advanced search or when a delay without an action. Default: 2 |
| pre-search  *(optional)* | **function** | Callback function that will be called on a search submit before the request is sent, receives the current URL state as a parameter that can be updated. |

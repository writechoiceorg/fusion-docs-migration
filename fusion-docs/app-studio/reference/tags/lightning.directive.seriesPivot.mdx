## Description

To render information in a pivot facet use the Series Pivot tag, this
tag has to be nested within a
[Chart Display tag](/app-studio/4.2/1056/chart-display). Please note
it will only render the second level of relevant filters. For more
details see the data object used in the examples below.

You can use the `response` attribute to load the data from the response.
You will also need to include the `query` directly on this tag if you
wish for the user to be able to filter using the data of this series or
alternatively add the `query` to the
[Chart Display tag](/app-studio/4.2/1056/chart-display).

For detail on how to change the color and background color see the demo
below, for more detail on what you can change and set using CSS see
[here.](http://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-design-and-style/style-by-css)

When rendering pivot facet data it is recommended that you always
include the [Chart
Legend tag](/app-studio/%7Bversion%7D/1112/chart-legend) within your [Chart
Display tag](/app-studio/4.2/1056/chart-display) as the examples below show.

```xml
<series:pivot

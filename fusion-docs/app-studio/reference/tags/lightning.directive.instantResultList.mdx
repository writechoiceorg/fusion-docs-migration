## Description

The Instant Result List directive allows you to show results matching
the users typed query under the search box.

### Caveats

* You cannot use an `ng-if` on a direct child of the
  `<instant:result-list>` tag, instead wrap your `ng-if` with a `<div>`
  tag. Example:-

**Do Not!**

```xml
<search:box>
     <instant:result-list>
         <search:result ng-if="type == 'foo'"></search:result>
         <search:result ng-if="type == 'bar'"></search:result>
     </instant:result-list>
 </search:box>
```

**Do**

```xml
<search:box>
     <instant:result-list>
         <div>
             <search:result ng-if="type == 'foo'"></search:result>
             <search:result ng-if="type == 'bar'"></search:result>
         </div>
     </instant:result-list>
 </search:box>
```

## Usage

as element:

```xml
<instant:result-list
       [platform="{string}"]
       [query="{string}"]
       [children-selector="{string}"]
       [wildcard="{string}"]>
</instant:result-list>
```

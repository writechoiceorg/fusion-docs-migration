To render information in facets, use the Series Facet tag, which must be nested within a [Chart Display tag](/fusion/5.9/3151/displaying-a-chart).

## Usage

```xml
<chart:display response="response" title="Current Products vs Recommended Products">
	<series:facet name="current_products" type="column" title="Current Products" color="blue"</series:facet>
	<series:facet name="recommended_products" type="line" title="Recommended Products" color="#006600"</series:facet>
</chart:display>
```

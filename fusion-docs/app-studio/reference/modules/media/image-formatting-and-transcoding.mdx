The Image tag displays images from a given field in a result. It will automatically resize, and cache the image for performance.

## Usage

This example shows how to display an image from a field:

```xml
<media:image field-name="image" field-prefix="http://foo.com" validate="true" width="150"></media:image>
```

In this case, the image URL is retrieved from a field named `image`. Before rendering, the image URL is prefixed with http://foo.com and its existence is validated. It is then resized to 150 pixels wide.

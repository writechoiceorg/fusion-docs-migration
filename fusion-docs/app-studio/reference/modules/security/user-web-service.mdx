Although it is disabled by default, there is a web service that returns all of the details for the currently logged in user.

Every operation and capability of Appkit can be invoked via REST-ful web service endpoints supporting both XML and JSON responses for asynchronous client-side operations, and integrating with external systems. For example, users can perform secure searches to any platform supported by Appkit.

Invoke the User web service by adding this parameter to `conf/security.conf`:

```yaml
webservice-enabled: true
```

Access the User web service via GET request at `/twigkit/api/user` for example:

```
http://my-twigkit-host/my-twigkit/twigkit/api/user
```

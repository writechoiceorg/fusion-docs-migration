## Comparison Tables

Different options for displaying tables on small screens. In terms of CSS, examples 1 and 2 are identical. Example 3 stacks, so is perhaps unsuitable for comparisons. Example 4 is more of a hybrid that is in line with our original sketches. Examples three and four both rely on `data-title` for the labels.

<Note>
Tested in latest Chrome, FireFox, Safari and Opera. IE10 and later works. IE9 should be possible with some effort.

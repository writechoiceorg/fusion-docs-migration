## How much space should you allow for Appkit logs?

Less than 50 MB for Appkit logs should be more than sufficient in production, after you reduce the log levels to INFO in `logback.xml`.

However this is entirely configurable. You can set up rolling daily logs, only holding back the last X. See the [Logback documentation for more information](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/appenders.html).

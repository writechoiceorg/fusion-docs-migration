## How are these products versioned?

* **Appkit** is versioned according to updates to the code base.
* **App Studio Enterprise** versions are loosely tied to the version of the Appkit framework it includes. An update from **4.8.0** to **4.9.0** may not include any changes to App Studio Enterprise.

## What about compatibility?

* Any version of **Appkit** can be used with Fusion 4.x. However, only Appkit 4.6.0+ can be used with Fusion 5.y.
* **App Studio Enterprise** can be used with any version of Fusion or Appkit.

## Can these products be updated independently?

* **Appkit** can be [updated](/how-to/791/upgrade-appkit-in-existing-apps) independently, assuming there are no version [compatibility](#what-about-compatibility) issues.
* **App Studio Enterprise** is released when a new version of Appkit is released. As a result, App Studio Enterprise itself does not need to be updated. To move to the latest code base, simply update the Appkit version within the project.

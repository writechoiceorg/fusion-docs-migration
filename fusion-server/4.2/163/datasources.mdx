A [collection](/fusion-server/4.2/166/collections) includes one or more datasources. A datasource is a configuration that manages the import and indexing of data into the collection.

The [Index Workbench](/fusion-server/4.2/158/index-workbench) provides a development environment for creating, configuring, and testing a datasource configuration. Every datasource configuration includes the following:

* Connector configuration, specifying the source and format of the incoming data.
* Parser configuration, describing a series of conditional parsing stages to transform the incoming data into PipelineDocument objects.
* Index pipeline configuration, consisting of stages that transform PipelineDocument objects into Solr documents to be indexed.

Collections and datasources can also be managed through the [REST API](/fusion-server/4.2/324/rest-ap-is).

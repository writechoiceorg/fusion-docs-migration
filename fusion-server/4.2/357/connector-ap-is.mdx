Connectors run as a standalone module. Requests for connector services are routed through the Lucidworks proxy layer, which manages the authorizations for users. This means that all connector requests must contain authentication credentials, and access to the connector REST APIs can be limited to certain users.

There are several REST APIs for Connectors, listed here:

* [Connector Datasources API](/fusion-server/4.2/353/connector-datasources-api)
* [Connector History API](/fusion-server/4.2/355/connector-history-api)
* [Connector Jobs API](/fusion-server/4.2/352/connector-jobs-api)
* [Connector Plugins API](/fusion-server/4.2/356/connector-plugins-api)
* [Connector Status API](/fusion-server/4.2/358/connector-status-api)

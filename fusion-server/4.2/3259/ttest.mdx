The `ttest` function performs a two sided t-test on two random samples drawn from two queries. The `ttest` function takes four parameters:

1. the numeric field on which to perform the t-test
2. the query for drawing the first sample
3. the query for drawing the second sample
4. the sample size for both samples

## Sample syntax

```sql
select ttest(sepal_width_d, "species_s:versicolor", "species_s:virginica", 150) as t,
       p_value
from iris
```

## Result set

The result set for the ttest function contains one row with the results of the ttest. The ttest function returns the t statistic. The p_value field can be selected to return the p-value for the ttest.

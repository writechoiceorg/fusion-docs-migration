A Fusion collection can be configured to map to multiple Solr collections, known as partitions in this context, where each partition contains data from a specific time range. An example is time-based partitioning for logs:

Once a collection is configured for time-base partitioning, Fusion automatically ages out old partitions and creates new ones, using the configured partition sizes, expiration intervals, and so on. No manual maintenance is needed.

This feature is not enabled by default. Enable it for each collection using the
[Collection Features API](/fusion-server/4.2/333/collection-features-api).

<Note>
Fusion cannot retroactively partition data that has already been indexed. It can only perform time-based partitioning on incoming data.

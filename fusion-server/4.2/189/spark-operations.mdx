[Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) is an open source cluster-computing framework that serves as a fast and general execution engine for large-scale data processing jobs that can be decomposed into stepwise tasks, which are distributed across a cluster of networked computers.

Spark improves on previous MapReduce implementations by using resilient distributed datasets (RDDs), a distributed memory abstraction that lets programmers perform in-memory computations on large clusters in a fault-tolerant manner.

## Spark in Fusion On-Prem

These topics provide information about Spark administration in Fusion Server:

* [**Spark Getting Started.**](/how-to/781/spark-getting-started-for-fusion-4-x) Starting Spark processes and working with the shell and the Spark UI
* [**Spark Driver Processes.**](/fusion-server/4.2/188/spark-job-drivers) Fusion jobs run on Spark use a driver process started by the API service
* [**Spark Configuration.**](/how-to/911/spark-configuration-for-fusion-4-x) How to configure Spark for maximum performance. The article also provides information about ports, directories, and configuring connections for an SSL-enabled Solr cluster.

Additionally, you can configure and run [Spark jobs](/fusion-server/4.2/187/spark-jobs) in Fusion, using the [Spark Jobs API](/fusion-server/4.2/312/spark-jobs-api) or the [Fusion UI](/fusion-server/4.2/116/fusion-ui).

## Spark with Fusion AI

With a Fusion AI license, you can also use the Spark cluster to [train and compile machine learning models](/fusion-ai/4.2/492/machine-learning-models-in-fusion), as well as to run experiments via the [Fusion UI](/fusion-ai/4.2/460/experiments) or the [Spark Jobs API](/fusion-server/4.2/312/spark-jobs-api).

These endpoints can be used to send data directly to an [index profile](/fusion-server/4.2/160/index-profiles). For index profile CRUD operations, see the [Index Profiles API](/fusion-server/4.2/348/index-profiles-api).

Index APIs include:

* [**Index Pipelines API.**](/fusion-server/4.2/351/index-pipelines-api) Index Pipelines are workflows to format data being ingested so it is prepared for indexing. This API manages those pipelines.
* [Index Profiles API](/fusion-server/4.2/348/index-profiles-api) - Profiles match pipelines with collections.
* [**Index Stages API.**](/fusion-server/4.2/349/index-stages-api) Index stages are the individual steps within index pipeline workflows. This API manages those steps.

For more information about structuring documents for indexing, see [Importing Data with the REST API](/how-to/865/import-data-with-the-rest-api).

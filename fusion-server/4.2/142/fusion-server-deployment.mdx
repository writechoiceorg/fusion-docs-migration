These topics explain how to plan for, install, and upgrade your Fusion Server deployment.

## On-premises deployment

### Architecture and requirements

* [**Review system requirements.**](/fusion-server/4.2/194/system-requirements) Start here to learn about required software and hardware.
* [**Review deployment types.**](/fusion-server/4.2/141/deployment-types) Learn about deployment types for demos, trials, development, and production.
* [**Start and stop Fusion Server.**](/how-to/716/start-or-stop-fusion) Start and stop everything or individual services.
* [**Learn about directories, files, and ports.**](/fusion-server/4.2/197/fusion-server-directories-files-and-ports)
* [**Review licensing information.**](/fusion-server/4.2/114/licensing)

### Deploy Fusion Server on-prem

* [**Install Fusion Server on a single node (Unix).**](/how-to/800/install-fusion-4-x-on-a-single-node#unix-installation) Install Fusion Server on a single Unix node. This is an easy way to try Fusion Server. Out-of-the-box, Fusion Server uses bundled instances of Solr, ZooKeeper, and Spark.
* [**Install Fusion Server on a single node (Windows).**](/how-to/800/install-fusion-4-x-on-a-single-node#windows-installation) Install Fusion Server on a single Unix node. This is an easy way to try Fusion Server. Out-of-the-box, Fusion Server uses bundled instances of Solr, ZooKeeper, and Spark.
* [**Learn about installing a Fusion cluster.**](/how-to/921/install-a-fusion-4-x-cluster) You can cluster Fusion Server, Solr, and ZooKeeper nodes in a number of ways.
* [**Install a Fusion cluster (Unix).**](/how-to/887/install-a-fusion-4-x-cluster-unix) Install multiple instances of Fusion Server, and of Solr and ZooKeeper, in a cluster.
* [**Install a Fusion cluster (Windows).**](/how-to/637/install-a-fusion-4-x-cluster-windows) Install multiple instances of Fusion Server, and of Solr and ZooKeeper, in a cluster.
* [**Integrate Fusion with an existing Solr deployment.**](/how-to/908/integrate-fusion-4-x-with-an-existing-solr-deployment) If you have an existing Solr deployment, you can integrate Fusion Server with that deployment (if it meets Fusion Serverâ€™s version requirement for Solr).
* [**Troubleshoot installation.**](/how-to/615/troubleshoot-when-installing-fusion-4-x) Troubleshoot difficulties that you might encounter when installing Fusion Server.

## Upgrade and maintain Fusion Server

* [**Upgrade Fusion.**](/how-to/616/upgrade-to-fusion-4-x) Run a migrator to upgrade Fusion Server.
* [**Migrate Fusion objects by hand.**](/how-to/836/migrate-fusion-objects) Migrate Fusion objects by hand. You might need to do this for objects that the migrator does not migrate automatically. You can also use this manual approach to migrate Fusion objects from development environments into testing and production environments, or to back up data and restore it after an incident of data loss.
* [**Add or move Fusion Server nodes.**](/how-to/855/scale-a-fusion-4-x-cluster) Add a new node to an existing Fusion cluster, or move Fusion from one node to another.

title: "Solr Dynamic Field Name Mapping"
permalink: "223"
---

This stage can be used to re-name existing fields to match Solr dynamic field names, so that they will be typed correctly by Solr.
It also can be used to specify fields which should be exempt from name changes as well as to set the dynamic type suffixes to a specified field. Note that the field that is processed by a Field Mapping stage prior to this stage will not be renamed, even if the stage config matches the field name.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

Index stages have the following variables available:

* `ctx`. [Context](/fusion-pipeline-javadocs/4.2/com/lucidworks/apollo/pipeline/context): used to pass variables between stages
* `doc`. [PipelineDocument](/fusion-pipeline-javadocs/4.2/com/lucidworks/apollo/common/pipeline/pipelinedocument): Fusion internal representation of a Solr Document. Please note that if you change this class in ways that affect the serialized form (adding fields, for example) you need to change the deserialization code in `GenericJSONDocumentMessageReader`.

The format required is `<request.q>`.

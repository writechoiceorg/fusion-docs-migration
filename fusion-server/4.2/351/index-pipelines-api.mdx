The Index Pipelines API provides methods for managing a set of named index pipelines.
Every pipeline is made up of one or more stages.
Stages can be defined during the creation of a pipeline, or stages can be defined separately and included into one or more pipelines.
For details of the REST API for index stages, see [Index Stages API](/fusion-server/4.2/349/index-stages-api).

Document processing proceeds stage by stage in a linear fashion.
The order of the stages in a pipeline is the order in which they were defined.
At installation, Fusion includes several pre-configured pipelines.
See [Index Pipelines](/fusion-server/4.2/162/index-pipelines) for details on these default pipelines.

For more information about structuring documents for indexing, see [Importing Data with the REST API](/how-to/865/import-data-with-the-rest-api).

## Examples

*List the 'default' pipeline:*

**REQUEST**

```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD https://FUSION_HOST:8764/api/index-pipelines/default
```

**RESPONSE**

```json
{
  "id" : "default",
  "stages" : [ {
    "type" : "solr-index",
    "id" : "solr-default",
    "skip" : false
  } ]
}
```

*Create an index pipeline named 'my-index-pipeline' with three stages, one of which does not yet exist:*

<Note>
In order to see this object within the [Fusion UI](/fusion-server/4.2/121/object-explorer), it **must** be associated with an app. To do this, create the object using the `/apps` endpoint.
</Note>



**REQUEST**

```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' -d '{"id":"my-index-pipeline","stages":[{"id":"tika","type":"tika-parser","includeImages":true},{"id":"conn_mapping","type":"ref"},{"id":"solr-default","type":"ref"}]}' https://FUSION_HOST:8764/api/index-pipelines
```

**RESPONSE**

```json
{
  "id" : "my-index-pipeline",
  "stages" : [ {
    "type" : "tika-parser",
    "id" : "tika",
    "includeImages" : true,
    "flattenCompound" : false,
    "addFailedDocs" : false,

    "type" : "ref",
    "id" : "solr-default",
    "skip" : false,
    "label" : "ref"
  } ]
}
```

*Reload the 'my-index-pipeline' pipeline:*

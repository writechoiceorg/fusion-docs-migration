Index profiles let your applications
[send documents for indexing to a consistent endpoint](/how-to/865/import-data-with-the-rest-api)
(the index profile endpoint) and change the underlying index pipeline as needed.

An index profile is also a simple way to use one pipeline for multiple collections, without any one collection "owning" the pipeline. Associating a profile with an index pipeline, or an index pipeline and a collection, is simply a mapping.

Finally, you can also specify configuration parameters for an index pipeline in the index profile.

You can use the API or UI to manage index profiles.

## Index Profiles in the API

* [Index Profiles API](/fusion-server/4.2/348/index-profiles-api) (`/index-profiles`)

  Create, read, update, and delete index profiles.
* [Index API](/fusion-server/4.2/350/index-api) (`/index`)

  Index data through an index profile by specifying the profile ID.

## Index Profiles in the UI

Index profiles are configured at **Indexing** > **Index Profiles**.

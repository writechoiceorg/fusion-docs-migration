A Filter Short Fields index stage removes short field values from a pipeline document according to a set of filters where each filter specifies a field name and a minimum length. All field values less than the specified length will be removed from the document.

For the REST API, this stage type is "filter-short-fields".

## Example Stage Specification

*Remove entities in the `author_s` field that are less than 3 characters:*

```json
{
  "type" : "filter-short-fields",
  "id" : "short-stage",
  "filters" : [ {
    "sourceField" : "author_s",
    "length" : 3
  } ],
  "skip" : false
}
```

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

Tasks are a flexible job type that can be used to clean up old logs or run any REST call.

## Task subtypes

The "task" job type has the following subtypes:

* [Log Cleanup](/fusion-server/4.2/387/log-cleanup-jobs)

  Delete old log messages from system logs collection.
* [REST Call](/fusion-server/4.2/384/rest-call-jobs)

  A versatile job type that runs an arbitrary REST/HTTP/Solr command.

## Task configuration

Tasks can be created and modified using the [Fusion UI](/fusion-server/4.2/184/jobs-overview#jobs-manager) or the [Tasks API](/fusion-server/4.2/317/tasks-api). They can be scheduled using the Fusion UI or the [Jobs API](/fusion-server/4.2/327/jobs-api).

The Apache Tika Parser index stage type includes rules for parsing documents with [Apache Tika](http://tika.apache.org/).
Fusion uses Tika v1.13.
(Note that components of the Solr distribution included with Fusion contian their own Tika jar files; these are not used by Fusion.)

## Compatibilty Issues

Raw streams create new docs which Tika then tries to parse again. For this reason, avoid using the SDK connector or any other client that streams to the index pipeline.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

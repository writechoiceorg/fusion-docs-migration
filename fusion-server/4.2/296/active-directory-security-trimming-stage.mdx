An Active Directory Security Trimming query pipeline stage retrieves an Active Directory userâ€™s security identifiers to build a security filter. This restricts the documents in the query result to only those documents for which a user has access permissions. Security trimming is commonly used in business to authenticate between administrative users and normal users, or to limit the site access of website users according to a login/password.

This stage supports [asynchronous processing](/fusion-server/4.2/169/query-pipeline-stages#async).

```

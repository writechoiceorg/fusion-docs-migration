*Indexing* converts your data into an indexed collection in Fusionâ€™s Solr core. It is critical for ensuring that your data is stored in a format that is ideal for your search application.

There are several REST APIs related to indexing operations:

* [Index API](/fusion-server/4.2/350/index-api)

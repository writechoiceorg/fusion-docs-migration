The Query Profiles API allows users to manage query profiles. Query profiles allow users to change query pipelines during search time while pointing the search toward a static endpoint. This gives flexibility to test different stage combinations without reconfiguration. For more information, see [Query Profiles](/fusion-server/4.2/174/query-profiles).

To run a query through a query profile, use the [Query API](/fusion-server/4.2/361/query-api).

* [Query pipelines](/fusion-server/4.2/173/query-pipelines) filter, transform, and augment Solr queries and responses in order to return all and only the most relevant search results.
* [Query pipeline stages](/fusion-server/4.2/169/query-pipeline-stages) are the components of a query pipeline, configured and ordered to produce the desired search results.
* [Query profiles](/fusion-server/4.2/174/query-profiles) provide aliases for query pipelines, enabling your application to point to the same endpoint regardless of the query pipeline behind it. A query profile can also specify the collection and/or configuration parameters for the query pipeline, if abstraction is desired for those aspects.
* [Custom Javascript query stages](/fusion-server/4.2/170/custom-java-script-stages-for-query-pipelines) are a versatile way to handle a wide range of special requirements in your pipeline.
* The [stored parameters collection](/fusion-server/4.2/172/stored-parameters-collection) stores Solr facet parameters for a particular document or product category.

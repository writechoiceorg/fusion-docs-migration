* [History API](/fusion-server/4.2/343/history-api), to retrieve historic events of each service in the system.
* [Nodes API](/fusion-server/4.2/345/nodes-api), to check the status of each node in the search cluster.
* [System API](/fusion-server/4.2/344/system-api), to retrieve system metrics, ping the system for life, flush buffers, or view active threads.
* [Usage API](/fusion-server/4.2/346/usage-api), to retrieve system information that is shared with Lucidworks about the size of your system.

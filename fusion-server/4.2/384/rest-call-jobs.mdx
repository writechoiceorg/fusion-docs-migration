A versatile job type that runs an arbitrary REST/HTTP/Solr command.

REST jobs can call external systems using:

* any HTTP or HTTPS request: `<http-protocol>://<path>`; requires JWT header.
* a Solr request: `solr://COLLECTION_NAME/…​`; authentication is handled.
* a Fusion service request: `extservice://SERVICE_NAME/<path>`; authentication is handled.

For example, you can configure this type of job to delete your old signals data:

1. Navigate to **Collections** > **Jobs**.
2. Click **Add** and select **REST Call**.

   The REST Call job configuration panel appears.
3. Enter an arbitrary ID for this job, such as "Delete-old-signals".
4. Enter the following endpoint URI, substituting the name of your signals collection for `signalsCollectionName`:

   ```
   solr://signalsCollectionName/update
   ```
   
5. In the **Call Method** field, select "post".
6. Under **Query Parameters**, enter the property name "wt" with the property value "json".
7. In the **Request entity (as string)** field, enter the following:

   ```xml
   <root><delete><query>timestamp_tdt:[* TO NOW-2WEEKS]</query></delete><commit /></root>
   ```

   See [Working with Dates](https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_6/working-with-dates.html) for details about date formatting.

   Your job configuration should look similar to this:

<Tip>
You can configure a schedule for this job at **System** > **Scheduler**.

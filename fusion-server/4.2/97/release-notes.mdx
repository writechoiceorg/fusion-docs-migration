## Deprecations and Removals

Every Fusion release adds or improves Fusion features and functionality. Occasionally, we also remove features and functionality. Before doing so, we “deprecate” them. Deprecated features are no longer officially supported by Lucidworks and will not be updated or maintained. In many cases, new features are introduced which replace and/or improve the functionality of the deprecated feature.

See [Deprecations and Removals](/fusion-server/4.2/8855/deprecations-and-removals) for a list of active deprecations and removals.

How long do I have before the feature is removed?

We give a minimum of one minor release cycle before removing a deprecated feature. For example:

* A feature is deprecated in Fusion 4.1.0, so it will not be removed before Fusion 4.2.0
* A feature is deprecated in Fusion 4.1.1, so it will not be removed before Fusion 4.2.0

<Note>
Deprecations are typically made in major and minor releases only. Maintenance release deprecations are less common.

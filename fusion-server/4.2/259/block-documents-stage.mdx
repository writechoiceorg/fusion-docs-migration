The Block Documents query pipeline stage removes documents from the result
based on a Block Documents rule which consists of the following elements:

* `field`. The document field to filter on.
* `keywords`. The words, phrases, or regex used as the filter.
* `mode`. Filtering logic applied to keywords, one of:

  + `exact`. exact matching on any item in the keywords list.
  + `phrase`. phrase matching on the items in the keywords list.
  + `regex`. treat items in the keywords list as a regex.
  + `match`. requires a match for every item in the keyword list, but does not require phrase matching.
* `blocks`. A list of document IDs for documents which are always removed from the query result.

The block documents rule is used to craft a Solr query.
The `keywords` are added to the `q` Solr query parameter, by default.
The configuration property `queryParam` can be used to specify a different Solr query parameter
to use as the keywords filter.
The rest of the rule is processed into the `fq` Solr query parameter.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

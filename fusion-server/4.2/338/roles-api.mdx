Roles are groups of permissions that allow access to the UI and the REST APIs. See [Roles](/fusion-server/4.2/126/roles) for details.

Security Realms can be configured to use LDAP group membership to assign Roles to users. See the [LDAP configuration](/how-to/721/configure-fusion-for-ldap) instructions for details.

## Create, Update or Delete Roles

The endpoint for this request can take the role ID as a request parameter:

`/api/roles/<id>`

The role ID string is generated by Fusion when the role is created.

A GET request returns the configured roles for a specific ID. If the ID is omitted from the path, all roles will be returned.

A POST request creates a new role. When creating a new role, the request path is `/api/roles`. If the role is created, the request returns the role ID.

<Note>
In order to see this object within the [Fusion UI](/fusion-server/4.2/121/object-explorer), it **must** be associated with an app. To do this, create the object using the `/apps` endpoint.
</Note>

A PUT request updates an existing role.

A DELETE request will remove the role configuration.

## Role Specification

To create or update a Role via a POST or PUT request, the request body is a JSON object with the following attributes:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| name  *Required* | A string containing the role name. |
| desc  *Optional* | A string containing a brief text description, for display on the Access Control "ROLES" panel. |
| permissions  *Optional* | A list of permissions, specified in JSON notation. See section [Permissions](/fusion-server/4.2/123/permissions) for details. |
| uiPermissions  *Optional* | A list of names of UI components. |

The following example describes a role with permissions to access Fusion Dashboards for collection "mdb1":

```json
{
  "name":"view-dashboard-mdb1",
  "desc":"can access/use analytics dashboard \"mdb1\" but not allowed to change dashboard controls.",
  "permissions":[
    {"methods":["GET"],"path":"/solr/system_banana/*"},
    {"methods":["GET"],"path":"/solr/{id}/*","params":{"id":["mdb1"]}},
    {"methods":["GET"],"path":"/solr/{id}/admin/luke","params":{"id":["mdb1"]}},
    {"methods":["GET"],"path":"/collections/system_banana"}
  ],
  "uiPermissions":[
    "dashboards",
    "fields"
  ]
}
```

The Landing Pages query pipeline stage provides the mechanism by which specific search queries will be pinned to certain URLs.
This stage returns one or more URLs which can be used for redirection.
It does not preform a redirection; this must be done by the calling application.
The redirection URLs are returned in a separate section of the Fusion response object, with attribute name `fusion`.

This stage is configured using Landing Page Rules, which consist of the following:

* `keyword`. Words, phrases, or a regex.
* `mode`. Filtering logic applied to the query, one of:

  + `exact`. The keyword and the query must match exactly. This is case-sensitive.
  + `phrase`. The phrase matching on the items in the keywords list.
  + `regex`. Treat items in the keywords list as a regex.
  + `match`. Must match every item in the keyword list, but does not require phrase matching.
* `url`. A list of URLs.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

The `probability` function calculates the probability that a value drawn from a numeric field will fall within specific range. The `probability` function takes four parameters:

1. the numeric field to compute the probability from
2. the numeric start range
3. the numeric end range
4. the sample size

## Sample syntax

```sql
select probability(sepal_length_d, 5.1, 7.7, 150) as prob
    from iris
```

## Result set

The result set for the `probability` function contains a single record with the calculated probability. The `probability` function returns the probability calculation.

Rewrite the `start` and `rows` parameters to request a constant number of documents from Solr, and apply `start` and `rows` pagination to the response at the end of the pipeline.

This stage is used in conjunction with other stages that rerank documents. It is included in the [default query pipeline](/fusion-ai/4.2/461/smart-answers) that enables [Smart Answers](/how-to/684/faq-solution-part-2#default-pipelines).

This stage requires a [Fusion AI](/fusion-ai/4.2/428/fusion-ai) license.

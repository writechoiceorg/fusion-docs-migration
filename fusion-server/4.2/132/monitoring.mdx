Fusion Server has functions built in for observability and monitoring with Fusionâ€™s tools or third-party monitoring tools.

## Fusion system metrics

Fusion system metrics are logged and available in the UI, in log files, and through the REST API.

* For an overview of noteworthy metrics that are logged and indexed,
  see [System Metrics](/fusion-server/4.2/198/system-metrics).
* See [System Administration with the Fusion UI](/fusion-server/4.2/129/system-administration).
* Read about [System Admin APIs](/fusion-server/4.2/347/system-admin-ap-is),
  including APIs for metrics and cluster status, in the REST API Reference Guide.

## Additional tools for monitoring Fusion

* Read about other necessary areas to monitor, such as Java Virtual Machines, Unix file systems, networks, and applications like Solr in [Monitor Fusion 4.x.x](/fusion-server/4.2/892/monitor-fusion-4-x-x).
* Read about health checks for components of your Fusion deployment in
  [Checking System State](/how-to/859/check-the-system-state).

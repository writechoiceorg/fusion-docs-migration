These reference topics provide complete information about the configuration properties of jobs for which the subtype is "task" or "spark".

Jobs with the subtype "datasource" have configuration schemas that depend on the connector type; see [Connectors Configuration Reference](/fusion-connectors/2/fusion-connectors).

For conceptual information and instructions for configuring and scheduling jobs, see [Jobs and Schedules](/fusion-server/4.2/184/jobs-overview).

<Note>
[Additional Spark jobs](/fusion-ai/4.2/572/jobs-configuration) are available with a [Fusion AI](/fusion-ai/4.2/428/fusion-ai) license.

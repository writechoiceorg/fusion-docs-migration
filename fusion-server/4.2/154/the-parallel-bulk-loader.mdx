Fusion Parallel Bulk Loader jobs enable bulk ingestion of structured and semi-structured data from big data systems, NoSQL databases, and common file formats like Parquet and Avro.

The Parallel Bulk Loader leverages the popularity of Spark as a prominent distributed computing platform for big data. A number of companies invest heavily in building production-ready Spark SQL data source implementations for big data and NoSQL systems, much as Lucidworks has done for Solr. The Parallel Bulk Loader uses connectors provided by the experts who develop these complex systems.

## Improvements

* The GitHub connector no longer accepts username and password as authentication methods. Instead, GitHub oAuth token Authentication is used to perform GitHub requests. See the [GitHub oAuth authentication page](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line#creating-a-token) for more information.

* The Jira connector is updated to use the latest available authentication methods.

* The Google Drive connector allows debug logging to view HTTP traffic securely.

* The Blob Store gives a more informative error message when an uploaded file has invalid schema or fields.

* Various UI improvements.

## Bug fixes

* Reduced the likelihood of the [Active Directory Connector for ACLs](/fusion-connectors/11/active-directory-connector-for-acls) failing during crawls.

* Fixed a bug that lowered performance on large query plans.

* Fixed a bug with the Alfresco connector that caused old and new versions of a document to be indexed during a recrawl. Now, only the latest document is indexed.

* Fixed a bug with the Alfresco connector that caused a moved document to be indexed at the previous *and* current location. Now, only the document in the current location is indexed.

* Fixed a bug with the Alfresco connector that prevented the `acls_ss` field from updating unless **Force Recrawl** was selected.

* Fixed a bug with the FTP connector that sometimes prevented files with non-English filenames from being indexed.

* Fixed a bug with the [Scala script job](/fusion-server/4.2/386/script-jobs) that sometimes resulted in job failures when indentation was used.

* Fixed a bug with V2 connectors that sometimes resulted in jobs completing before all documents were indexed.

* Fixed a bug with V2 connectors that sometimes caused crawls to stall and fail due to an Out of Memory (OOM) error.

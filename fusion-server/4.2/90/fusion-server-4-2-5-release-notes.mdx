## New features

### Lucidworks Fusion Smart Answers

Fusion 4.2.5 introduces [Lucidworks Fusion Smart Answers](/fusion-ai/4.2/461/smart-answers), an AI-driven question answering system which combines the power of Solr and neural dense vectors to recommend solutions to users.

### New Rules UI features

Fusion 4.2.5 introduces several new features to the Rules UI:

* Double-click to expand and collapse UI panels.

    </Frame>

* Toggle for advanced fields.

    <Frame>
      [](/assets/images/4.2/animations/rules-advanced-toggle.webm)
    </Frame>

    </Frame>

### Other new features

* Fusion services now support SSL and certificate authentication.

## Improvements

* Improved the default sort behavior for [aggregations](/fusion-ai/4.2/473/aggregations).

* The SQL query `IS NULL` now seeks out empty values as expected.

* Fixed a bug with the Fusion SQL service that prevented a collection from sharing a name with an collection alias.

* Previously, SQL aggregations were limited to 250 aggregations. Now, the default limit is 5,000 aggregations, and the limit is configureable. To set the limit to 10,000 aggregations, use the following command:

  ```bash
  curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' -d '10000' http://localhost:8764/api/apollo/configurations/fusion.sql.bucket_size_limit
  ```
  

* Improved how multi-word synonyms are handled by [query rewriting](/fusion-ai/4.2/489/query-rewriting).

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue with the [XML Transformation index pipeline stage](/fusion-server/4.2/245/xml-transformation-index-stage) that prevented it from parsing information from an RSS feed.

* Fixed a bug that sometimes caused the [Token and Phrase Spell Correction Job](/fusion-ai/4.2/566/token-and-phrase-spell-correction-job) to fail with an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` error.

* Fixed a bug that prevented security trimming from working on the Alfescro connector in Fusion 4.2.4.

* Fixed a bug that sometimes resulted in documents on CrawlDB being marked as incomplete when crawl operations were started and stopped multiple times.

* Performance is improved in aggregation collections.

* Fixed a bug that caused [Head/Tail Analysis jobs](/fusion-ai/4.2/552/head-tail-analysis-jobs) to fail due to a misconfigured collection name.

## Known issues

* The Couchbase connector does not work with Couchbase versions 5 or later. This will be addressed in Fusion 4.2.6.

* The FTP connector sometimes prevents files with non-English filenames from being indexed.

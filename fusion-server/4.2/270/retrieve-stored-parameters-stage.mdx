The Retrieve Stored Parameters stage is used to add parameters to the downstream Solr query stage in the pipeline.
The primary use case for this query stage is in eCommerce applications to organize and enhance search query results,
where the parameters added to the Solr query are used for faceting.
This stage is used in query pipelines for applications where the documents in the collection are to be
classified according to a known category hierarchy that is
stored in Fusion as an auxiliary "stored parameters" collection.

The information in a taxonomy is meta-information about the categories used to classify a set of things.
For an eCommerce site, the set of things are items in the product catalog,
which are stored in a Fusion collection, referred to as the primary collection.
The taxonomy itself is specified as a set of
[categories](/fusion-server/4.2/304/taxonomy-api#taxonomyapi-taxonomystructure)
which are stored in an auxiliary collection and naming conventions
relate the primary and auxiliary collections so that for
a primary collection named "COLL", the auxiliary taxonomy
is stored in a collection named "COLL_stored_parameters".

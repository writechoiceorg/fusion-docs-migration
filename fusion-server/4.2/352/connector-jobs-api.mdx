<Note>
This API is deprecated. Use the [Jobs API](/fusion-server/4.2/327/jobs-api) instead.
</Note>

The Connector Jobs API provides methods to start, monitor, and stop a datasource. A datasource is specific connector instance that connects to a defined repository, collects content, and sends it through an index pipeline.

The Connector Jobs API can also provide detailed information about the indexing job and each stage of the index pipeline.

To define and launch a job, simply use the datasource id with a POST request to start crawling.

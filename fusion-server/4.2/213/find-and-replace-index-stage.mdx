The Find and Replace stage uses exact string matching to standardize or remove a set of specific passages, phrases, or words from a document field.

This stage is configured with one or more rules. Each rule specifies:

* One or more text strings to search for matching text (phrases or words)
* A *single* text string that is the replacement value

<Tip>
**Important**

When the replacement string is empty, the system deletes the matched text from the document field.
</Tip>

Configure the Find and Replace stage in one of the following ways:

* [Fusion blob store setup](#fusion-blob-store-setup)
* [Fusion UI or REST API setup](#fusion-ui-or-rest-api-setup)

### Fusion blob store setup

Setting up the stage using Fusion’s blob store is referred to as **Find - List - Replace**.

The general procedure for *each* find/list/replace action is:

* Upload a file that contains a list of text passages to be standardized into the [Fusion Blob Store](/fusion-server/4.2/305/blob-store-api).
* Each file:

  + Contains one line for each text passage
  + Has a `.lst` suffix

The required rule properties to standardize the text are the:

* Document field to scan
* Name of the `.lst` file uploaded to the blob store

  <Note>
  The `.lst` suffix must be included in the file name designated in the rule.
  </Note>


* Value of the replacement text

<Tip>
**Important**

Multiple `.lst` files can be uploaded and used to perform find/replace actions.
</Tip>

#### Example

One example could be to remove the country information and replace it with the phrase: **country not displayed for security purposes** to make the data anonymous for reporting.

* The document field to scan is **country**.
* The name of the `.lst` file in this example is `country.lst`. An excerpt is:

```
Afghanistan
Afrique
Albania
Albanie
Alderney
Algeria
Algérie
Allemagne
America
Amérique
Amériques
American Samoa
Andorra
Andorre
Angleterre
Anglo-Normandes
Angola
Anguilla
Antigua and Barbuda
Antigua et Barbuda
Antilles
Antilles Néerlandaises
Arabie Saoudite
Argentina
Argentine
Arménie
Aruba
```

* The value of the replacement text is: **country not displayed for security purposes**.

If the text of the passages scanned includes any of the items in the `country.lst` file, it is replaced with the phrase: **country not displayed for security purposes**.

### Fusion UI or REST API setup

Setting up the stage using the Fusion UI or REST API is referred to as **Find - Replace**.

The Fusion UI access path is:

* Sign in to Fusion.
* Select the application.
* Select **Indexing > Index Workbench**.
* Select **Add a Stage**.
* Select **Find and Replace** in the Field Transformation section.
* Enter values in the fields as described in the [Configuration section](#configuration).

    <Note>
    The REST API uses the parameters specified below.
    </Note>

The required rule properties to standardize the text are the:

* Document field to scan
* List of find/replace pairs

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

The Configurations API allows setting global properties for Fusion.

Some settings are not set by any configuration file but are reported as settings from the operating system. Those settings cannot be changed with this API.

## Examples

*Show the configuration items that include the pattern 'zk-connect', with verbose enabled:*

```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD https://FUSION_HOST:8764/api/configurations?verbose=true&pattern=zk-connect
```

RESPONSE

  "com.lucidworks.apollo-admin.config/zk-connect" : [ {

  } ]
}
```

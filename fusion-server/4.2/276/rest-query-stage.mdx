The REST Query pipeline stage is available in Fusion versions 3.0 and later.

<Note>
In Fusion version 3.0 and earlier, this pipeline stage was called the Query RPC Stage. RPC is the acronym for Remote Procedure Calls.

The notation to send text as payload in **Request entity (as string)** field is `<request.q>`.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

Connectors are the out-of-the-box components for pulling your data into Fusion. Lucidworks provides a wide variety of connectors, each specialized for a particular data type. When you add a [datasource](/fusion-server/4.2/163/datasources) to a
[collection](/fusion-server/4.2/166/collections), you specify the connector to use for ingesting data.

Connectors are distributed separately from Fusion Server. For complete information, see [Fusion Connectors](/fusion-connectors/2/fusion-connectors).

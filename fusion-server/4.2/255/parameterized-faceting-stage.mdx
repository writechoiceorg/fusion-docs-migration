The Parameterized Faceting query pipeline stage determines the most frequent value for a given field, then uses that value to look up stored parameters and auto-select the most appropriate facet for a query.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

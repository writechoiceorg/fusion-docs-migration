The Fusion [access control](/fusion-server/4.2/124/access-control) component handles user authentication and authorization.
It runs in the same process as the Fusion UI and provides the following sets of endpoints:

* [User API](/fusion-server/4.2/340/user-api): create, update, delete and list user records in Fusion.
* [Roles API](/fusion-server/4.2/338/roles-api): create, update, delete and list roles which grant users different levels of permissions in the system.
* [Realms API](/fusion-server/4.2/337/realms-api): create, update, delete and list realms.
* [Sessions API](/fusion-server/4.2/339/sessions-api): create an authenticated session and session cookie.

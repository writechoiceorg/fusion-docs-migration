A datasource is a configuration that manages the import and indexing of data into the collection.

Datasources are created using the [Index Workbench](/fusion-server/4.2/158/index-workbench), or at **Indexing** > **Datasources**, or using the [Connector Datasources API](/fusion-server/4.2/353/connector-datasources-api).

A datasource is also a job that can run on demand or on a schedule.

The Field Facet query pipeline stage is used to add a
link:[Solr Field Facet query](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Faceting#Faceting-Field-ValueFacetingParameters)
to the search query pipeline.

A field facet query computes the top values for a field and returns the list of those values along with a count of the subset
of documents in the search results which match that term.
Field faceting works best over fields which contain a single label or set of labels from a finite, controlled lexicon
such as product category.
Facet field parameters can be tuned for performance, see:
[Facet Field Configuration](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Faceting#Faceting-Field-ValueFacetingParameters).

It is possible to specify more than one field facets.
For each field facet you must specify the field name plus the following additional parameters:

* **Limit.** The maximum number of terms to be returned. Default 100.
* **Offset.** The number of top facet values to skip in the response. Default 0.
* **Sort.** The order in which to list facet values: `count` ordering is by documents per term, descending, and `index` ordering is sorted on term values themselves.
* **Missing.** The number of documents in the results set which have no value for the facet field.
* **Choice of facet method (advanced).** Specify Solr algorithm used to calculate facet counts.
  (See [Facet Method Configuration](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Faceting#Faceting-Thefacet.methodParameter) for details).
  One of:

  + `enum`. Small number of distinct categories.
  + `fc` ("field cache"). Many different values in the field, each document has low number of values, multi-valued field.
  + `fcs` ("single value string fields"). Good for rapidly changing indexes.

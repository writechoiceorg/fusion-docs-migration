The Solr API is used to manage collection-level configurations.

The path for this request is:

`/api/solr/<collectionName>/<solrRequest>`

where *`<collectionName>`* is the name of an specific collection and `<solrRequest>` is the Solr command you wish to run.

Since this API proxies requests to Solr, each available method corresponds to the method in Solr. So, a GET request to Solr would use the GET method of this endpoint; a POST would use the POST method, etc.

Depending on the request, the response may consist of records that match a query
or output from a Schema API request.

## Examples

*Query Solr for documents in the 'docs' collection containing the term 'solr', limiting the results to only 2 records, returning only the title, and in JSON format:*

```
https://FUSION_HOST:8764/api/solr/docs/select?q=solr&rows=2&fl=title&wt=json

The Parser API works much like the [Index Pipelines API](/fusion-server/4.2/351/index-pipelines-api) and the [Query Pipelines API](/fusion-server/4.2/360/query-pipelines-api), providing CRUD operations over parser configurations.

To configure an index pipeline to use a specific parser, see the [Index Pipelines API](/fusion-server/4.2/351/index-pipelines-api).

<Note>
In order to see this object within the [Fusion UI](/fusion-server/4.2/121/object-explorer), it **must** be associated with an app. To do this, create the object using the `/apps` endpoint.

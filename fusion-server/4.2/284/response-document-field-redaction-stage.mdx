This is a [response rewriting](/fusion-ai/4.2/449/response-rewriting) stage that removes fields that match a regular expression from a document. This stage must be used *after* the [Solr Query stage](/fusion-server/4.2/265/solr-query-stage) in your pipeline.

<Tip>
The `sourceField`/**Source Field** can be a [String Template](/fusion-server/4.2/135/messaging-and-alerting#string-templates).
</Tip>

This stage adds to the context a list of maps (`type String, String`) that tracks, based on document position, which fields were removed from the document.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

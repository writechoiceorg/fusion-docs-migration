Escape special characters in a query.

This stage is used in the [default query pipeline](/fusion-ai/4.2/461/smart-answers) that enables [Smart Answers](/how-to/684/faq-solution-part-2#default-pipelines). See [Detailed Pipeline Setup](/fusion-ai/4.2/509/smart-answers-detailed-pipeline-setup) for configuration guidelines. In the Smart Answers use case, queries are natural-language questions. They tend to be longer than regular queries and with punctuation which we do not want to interpret as Lucene/Solr query operators.

This stage requires a [Fusion AI](/fusion-ai/4.2/428/fusion-ai) license.

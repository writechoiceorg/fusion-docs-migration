title: "Tensorflow Deep Encoding Query Stage"
permalink: "291"
---

Use a [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) deep learning model to encode and clusterize queries into a fixed dense vector space.

This stage is used in the [default query pipeline](/fusion-ai/4.2/461/smart-answers) that enables [Smart Answers](/how-to/684/faq-solution-part-2#default-pipelines). See [Detailed Pipeline Setup](/fusion-ai/4.2/509/smart-answers-detailed-pipeline-setup) for configuration guidelines.

<Note>
If you are using a dynamic schema, make sure this stage is added *after* the [Solr Dynamic Field Name Mapping stage](/fusion-server/4.2/223/solr-dynamic-field-name-mapping).
</Note>

This stage requires a [Fusion AI](/fusion-ai/4.2/428/fusion-ai) license.

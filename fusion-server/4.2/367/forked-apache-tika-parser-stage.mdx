A simplified Apache Tika parser more geared towards an Enterprise Search crawl where all documents are parsed in a forked Java Virtual Machine. If memory issues occur during the parse, such as an Out Of Memory condition, the connector job will be unaffected.

<Tip>
**Important**

The Forked Apache Tika parser is only available on Fusion 4.2.4+. To use this parser, you will be required to [update](/how-to/616/upgrade-to-fusion-4-x) to the latest version of Fusion.

The Write Log Message Index stage (called the Log a Message stage in versions earlier than 3.0) is an extension of Fusionâ€™s [Logging Index Stage](/fusion-server/4.2/242/logging-index-stage),
which logs any message sent to the configured logging system using the [Messaging Services](/fusion-server/4.2/135/messaging-and-alerting).

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

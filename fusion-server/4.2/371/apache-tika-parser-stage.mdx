Apache Tika is a versatile parser that supports many types of unstructured document formats, such as HTML, PDF, Microsoft Office documents, OpenOffice, RTF, audio, video, images, and more. A complete list of supported formats is available at http://tika.apache.org/.

To perform image text extraction when **Include images** is enabled, [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) should be installed in the server hosting Fusion.

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

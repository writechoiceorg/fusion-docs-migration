You can run a query through a [query profile](/fusion-server/4.2/174/query-profiles) by specifying the profile ID and appending the request with a [Solr query string](/fusion-server/4.2/394/solr-query-language-cheat-sheet), as in `/api/query/<id>?<solrQuery>`.

For query profile CRUD operations, see the [Query Profiles API](/fusion-server/4.2/363/query-profiles-api).

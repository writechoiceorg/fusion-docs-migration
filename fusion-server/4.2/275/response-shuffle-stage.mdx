This is a [response rewriting](/fusion-ai/4.2/449/response-rewriting) stage that helps "de-bias" results by shuffling the top N results randomly. Since most users click on result #1 before #2, this stage is helpful for distributing clicks more evenly among the top N results. This stage must be used *after* the [Solr Query stage](/fusion-server/4.2/265/solr-query-stage) in your pipeline.

This stage is especially useful when combined with [experiments](/fusion-ai/4.2/460/experiments), where a small percentage of traffic is given shuffled results to minimize position bias when using click signals for ranking. The [Response Pairwise Swap stage](/fusion-ai/4.2/510/response-pairwise-swap-stage) provides an another method for minimizing this bias.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

Query stages have the following variables available:

* `ctx`. [Context](/fusion-pipeline-javadocs/4.2/com/lucidworks/apollo/pipeline/context): used to pass variables between stages
* `reqResp`. [QueryRequestAndResponse](/fusion-pipeline-javadocs/4.2/com/lucidworks/apollo/pipeline/query/queryrequestandresponse): deserializes pre-request parameters and makes them available

The format required is `<request.q>`.

## Example

Check that a query has an `fq` filter on a given field for a given value:

In the UI, set property name to `ids` and Property Value to `req.hasParam("fq")`

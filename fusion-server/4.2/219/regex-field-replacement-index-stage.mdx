The Regex Field Replacement index stage lets you match against a source field and append or overwrite that field or another one with a replacement string. It uses the
[java.util.regex](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html) library.

One notable feature is support for flags in the prefix of the pattern, such as `(?iu)\w+` where the `i` flag means case-insensitive and `u` means Unicode-aware case folding. You can also configure the desired behavior when there is no match. Additionally, you can use capture groups in your replacement configuration using `$1` to denote the first capture group.

## Configuration

<Tip>
When entering configuration values in the UI, use *unescaped* characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use *escaped* characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.

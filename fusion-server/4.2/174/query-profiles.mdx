Query profiles let you consistently point your search application at a static endpoint, but give you the flexibility to change the actual query pipeline being used (and optionally, the collection and/or configuration parameters for the query pipeline).

For example, an e-commerce site might want to create a query pipeline to support a month-long promotion. After the query pipeline is configured, it can be easily enabled by changing the query profile in use by the front-end application to use the new pipeline.

To run a query through a query profile, use the REST API as described below. For CRUD operations, you can use either the REST API or the Fusion UI.

## Rules Simulator query profile

The [Rules Simulator](/fusion-ai/4.2/484/simulator) allows product owners to experiment with rules and other query rewrites in the `_query_rewrite_staging` collection before deploying them to the `_query_rewrite` collection.

Each app has a `_rules_simulator` query profile, configured to use the `_query_rewrite_staging` collection for query rewrites instead of the `_query_rewrite` collection. This profile is created automatically whenever a new app is created.

## Query profiles in the REST API

* [Query Profiles API](/fusion-server/4.2/363/query-profiles-api) (`/query-profiles`)

  Create, read, update, and delete query profiles.
* [Query API](/fusion-server/4.2/361/query-api) (`/query`)

  Run a query through a query profile by specifying the profile ID and appending the request with a [Solr query string](/fusion-server/4.2/199/solr-query-language-cheat-sheet), as in `/api/query/<id>?<solrQuery>`.

## Query profiles in the UI

Query profiles are configured at **Querying** > **Query Profiles**.

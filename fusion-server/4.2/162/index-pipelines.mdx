Index pipelines transform incoming data into `PipelineDocument` objects for indexing by Fusion-managed Solr service.
An index pipeline consists of a series of configurable
[index pipeline stages](/fusion-server/4.2/161/index-pipeline-stages),
each performing a different transformation on the data before passing the result to the next stage in the pipeline.
The final stage is the
[Solr Indexer stage](/fusion-server/4.2/227/solr-indexer-stage),
which transforms the PipelineDocument into a Solr document and submits it to Solr for indexing in a specific
[Collection](/fusion-server/4.2/166/collections).

Each configured datasource has an associated index pipeline and uses a
[connector](/fusion-connectors/63/configuration-reference)
to fetch data to parse and then input into the index pipeline.

Alternatively, documents can be submitted directly to an index pipeline or profile with the REST API; see
[Importing Data with the REST API](/how-to/865/import-data-with-the-rest-api).

A pipeline can be reused across multiple collections. Fusion provides a set of built-in pipelines. You can use the Index Workbench or the
[Index Pipelines API](/fusion-server/4.2/351/index-pipelines-api)
to develop custom index pipelines to suit any datasource or application.

When a Fusion collection is created using the Fusion UI, a pair of index and query pipelines are created to that pipeline, where the pipeline name is the collection name with the suffix "-default". This pipeline consists of a
[Field Mapping index stage](/fusion-server/4.2/224/field-mapping-index-stage).

Although default pipelines are created when a Fusion collection is created, they are not deleted when the collection is deleted.
This is because pipelines can be used across collections, so a named pipeline, although originally associated with a collection, can be used by several collections.

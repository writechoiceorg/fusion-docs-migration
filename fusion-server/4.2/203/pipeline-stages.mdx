Index Pipeline stages are used to create and modify PipelineDocument objects.

Query Pipeline stages are used to modify Request objects
and Response objects.

## Pipeline Stage Properties

Fusion associates a pipeline stage definition with a unique ID and stores the definition so that stages can be reused across pipelines and applications.
In addition to an ID, all stages have the following properties:

* **type** (required): an enumeration, one of the defined Fusion pipeline stage types, e.g., "index-logging". If the Fusion UI is used to define the stage, this property is filled in automatically.
* **label** (optional) : a string field with a maximum length of 255 characters. The label is displayed on the Fusion UI.
* **skip** (optional): a boolean value, If true, pipeline processing bypasses this stage altogether. The default is **false**.
* **condition** (optional): a JavaScript expression that evaluates to true (1) or false (0).
  If this condition evaluates to false, this stage is skipped. The default is **true**.

## Pipeline Condition Expression

The JavaScript expression specified in the condition property of a pipeline stage has access the pipeline objects.

### Index Pipeline Stage Condition Example

An index PipelineDocument has two available variables: "doc" and "ctx".

Check whether pipeline document contains a named field:

```js
doc.hasField("acl_ss")
```

### Query pipeline stage Condition Example

Process query based the query Request object:

```js
request.hasParam("fusion-user-name") && request.getFirstParam("fusion-user-name").equals("SuperUser");
!request.hasParam("isFusionPluginQuery")
```

The first condition checks that the request parameter "fusion-user-name" is present and has the value "SuperUser".
The second condition checks that the request parameter "isFusionPluginQuery" is not present.

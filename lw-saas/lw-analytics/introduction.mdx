## Basics of Analytics Studio 

Site analytics is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data in your digital marketplace to understand customer needs, optimize the shopping experience, and drive growth. It lets you make informed decisions and adapt quickly to changes in consumer behavior and trends in user interactions.

Analytics Studio applies the concepts of site analytics to your search experience to gain insights into product performance and how search settings influence customer behavior. These search analytics include metrics that can help you make data-driven decisions to enhance sales, optimize search result layouts, and improve the customer experience.

Analytics Studio collects data about user (visitor) searches, browsing, facet usage, conversions, and more with the [signals beacon](/lw-platform/analytics/k649vy/signals-beacon). The signals beacon is an HTML code snippet, also known as a tracking pixel, that can be added to your site. After you customize the signals beacon for your search experience, the beacon is used to collect query, click, cart-add, purchase, and facet usage signals to generate a larger picture view of performance and behavior.

## Types of metrics

The Signals analytics dashboard supports the following metrics:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Chart name | Description |
| Abandoned Cart Rate | Measures the percentage of shopping carts that are created but not converted into purchases. This metric is crucial for understanding issues in the checkout process. |
| Add to Cart Rate | Measures the percentage of clicks that result in an item being added to the shopping cart. This metric highlights the effectiveness of product pages and user readiness to purchase. For example, a cart add rate of 2.0% indicates that for every 100 product clicks, 2 items are added to the cart. Monitoring this metric can help identify areas where improvements in product descriptions, images, or pricing strategies could drive better results. |
| Average Order Value | Displays the average price value of orders for the selected time period. This metric is crucial for understanding how much revenue is generated per order, which helps in evaluating pricing strategies and customer spending behavior.  |
| Conversion Rate | Measures the effectiveness of a website, campaign, or action in achieving a specific goal, such as purchases, sign-ups, or downloads. It reflects how well you convert visitors or actions into successful outcomes. |
| Facet Usage | Measures facet usage over time for the given period. Shows how many of each facet were selected for the given period.  |
| Queries with Zero Results | List of query terms that were searched and yielded no results the most frequently. |
| Revenue Per Visitor | Average revenue generated by each visitor to your site over time, for the given period. It is a combination metric of conversion rate and average order value. Arguably the most important metric in assessing the performance of an ecommerce site. |
| Search Add to Cart Rate | Measures the percentage of users who add a product to their cart after finding it through the site’s search function. A high search add-to-cart rate indicates that the search function is successfully leading users to products they are interested in.  |
| Search Click Through Rate | Measures the percentage of users who click on a search result after performing a query. This metric is a direct indicator of how well your search results align with user intent and the relevance of your content. A high CTR suggests that users find the results appealing and useful. |
| Search Conversion Rate | Measures the percentage of searches that result in a completed purchase. This metric represents the final step in the user journey from query to conversion, offering a clear indicator of overall search effectiveness and customer satisfaction. |
| Search Exit Rate | The percentage of traffic that does not take positive action after using search for the given duration. A positive action is defined as a click, add-to-cart, or purchase action. |
| Top Performing Products | Products with the most views and the highest conversions. This metric is useful for understanding which products lead to engagement and conversions. |
| Top Search Terms | Shows the terms or phrases searched most often over the selected time period. It also provides the corresponding click rate, cart rate, purchase rate, and revenue, helping you identify high-performing queries and trends in user interest. |
| Total Searches | Shows the total number of searches over the selected time period. This metric highlights user engagement with the search functionality and can guide improvements in content and indexing. |
| Underperforming Products | Products with the most clicks but lowest conversions (greater than 0). Useful for identifying products that may need attention beyond superficial product information, such as description, images, reviews, and ratings. |
| Zero Result Search Rate | Displays the average percentage of searches that returned zero results for the selected time period. This metric helps you identify gaps in content or product availability. |

<Frame caption="Create a signals store">
  ![Create a signals store](/images/lw-platform/analytics/signals-store-create.png)
</Frame>

1. In the **Name** field, enter a unique user-defined for the signals store.
2. In the **Region** field, select the geographical area for the signal store.

   <Note>   This selection cannot be changed. If you need a signal store in a different region, you need to create another signal store with the other region specified.</Note>
3. Click **Create**.
After the signal store is created, you can configure the [signals beacon](/lw-platform/analytics/k649vy/signals-beacon).

### Signal fields stored

### Technical components

The properties of each signal store include:

* User-defined name.
* Universally unique identifier (`uuid`) of the signals store.
* Location of the signal store, which is also referred to as a data cell

The `uuid` and `data cell` define the endpoint where the signals are sent. For example, `<signals_store.uuid>.signals.lucidworks.com` is a `CNAME` to the appropriate data cell endpoint.

For more information about signals, see [signals](/lw-platform/analytics/0le96f/signals).

## Analytics Studio and Commerce Studio


Analytics Studio provides actionable insights by leveraging signals data from your search application. These signals capture essential metrics that reflect the performance and impact of your search experience, helping you measure and optimize its value.

Both merchandisers and data analysts should actively monitor data from Analytics Studio to ensure that decisions about search results and merchandising strategies are informed by actual customer behavior. By leveraging this data, teams can continuously refine their search application to meet business goals and enhance customer satisfaction.

### Key metrics captured by Analytics Studio

Analytics Studio tracks three critical categories of data:

* **Business metrics:** Understand the financial impact of your search application by analyzing metrics like average order value (AOV) and revenue per visitor (RPV).
* **Query metrics:** Evaluate search effectiveness through data such as top search terms, zero search result rate, and queries with zero result. 
* **User action metrics:** Monitor customer behavior by analyzing interactions like click through rate and add cart rate. 

These metrics collectively provide a comprehensive view of your search quality and the value your search application delivers to your business and customers.

### How Analytics Studio integrates with Commerce Studio
In Commerce Studio, metrics from Analytics Studio can be displayed directly on product cards. This integration enables you to make data-driven decisions when curating your search results.

For instance, RPV (revenue per visitor) can highlight products generating significant revenue but lacking sufficient visibility in search results. Such insights help identify opportunities to boost underperforming high-profit items, ensuring they are prioritized appropriately to maximize revenue potential.

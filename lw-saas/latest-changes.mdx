<Update label="2025-05-28" description="Lucidworks AI">
  **Lucidworks AI now supports chunking**

  Lucidworks AI now supports document chunking, a major advancement for search and generative AI quality and performance. Chunking breaks large documents into smaller, meaningful segmentsâ€”called chunks. Each chunk captures either lexical content for keyword-based search or semantic vectors for neural search.

    <SupademoEmbed />

  When paired with Fusion, you can retrieve the most relevant part of a document, rather than treating the document as a single block.

<Update label="2025-04-12" description="Commerce Studio">
  **Commerce Studio adds analytics-driven search optimization with Analytics Studio**

  Commerce Studio now leverages data from Analytics Studio to deliver deeper, data-driven insights for optimizing search relevance. This update introduces product-level analytics that directly inform search customization strategies, helping merchandisers fine-tune search experiences based on real user behavior.

  The integrated data includes detailed metrics for each product, such as clicks, purchases, and revenue. 
  
  Merchandisers can view these insights directly within the visual editor to guide relevance tuning in context.

<Update label="2025-04-02" description="Signals Beacon">
  **Capture signals using the new Signals API**

  The Signals API and the embed token feature can be used instead of the signals beacon to collect query, click, cart-add, and purchase signals. When the signals are collected, you can use the insights and analytics in Analytics Studio to help refine your site and improve customer interactions.
